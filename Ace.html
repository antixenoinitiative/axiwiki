<h1>Ace Leaderboard</h1>

<p>For those who go beyond. This rank is a true test of a pilot's abilities, based on a composite ammo usage, total damage taken, and time taken scale. Use a Chieftain and any combination of Gauss cannons to defeat a Medusa.</p>

<p>Restrictions</p>
<p>- Basic Ammo only</p>
<p>- Ship name must contain 'GTM'</p>
<p>- Hammer gauss are not allowed</p>

<p>Score your fight using the /ace bot command. The top 10 CMDRs will hold the @Ace rank. This is a competitive system and you can lose this rank should someone push you out of the Top 10.</p>
