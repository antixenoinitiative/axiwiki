# Disengagement

Whether in a small, medium, or large ship, flight strategies should be considered to get into and out of combat with thargoids. Understanding when to run and how, can save the pilot precious rebuy funds and cargo. If things start to go sour in an encounter, you can and should disengage, seek repair, and try again.

## Same Instance Disengagement
### On Foot

Scavengers are sluggish and have limited combat abilities. Recall your ship and just keep running. It would be surprising if Scavengers somehow surround you and even then, they don’t present much threat.
Revenenants have strong lasers and significant range. If you find yourself on-foot and running from Revenants, with each stride you need to run to the next obstacle that can provide any cover. Their laser will quickly deplete suit shields. Stealth is your best friend when in Revenant territory.
When recalling your ship, the ship can choose to land anywhere within a 1km radius of your position when you recall it. The Revenant’s range being itself 1km, a rule of thumb for getting the ship and yourself out of the area safely is to run 2 km away from the Revenants area of operation, before recalling the ship. Alternatively, a strong enough shield and hull could possibly tank the damage for long enough to make a getaway.

### When the Thargoid is Slow

Thargoids have the potential to lose their target-lock. When Thargoids don’t have a target-lock, after a short duration of searching, they will begin an animation where they prepare to and eventually wake-out of the instance. After maneuvering outside of firing range and depending on ship-signature, with sufficient distance away from the Thargoid, a maneuver away from its alignment axis can cause the Thargoid to lose target-lock. This will be obvious, as the Thargoid continues on a straight path no longer tracking the player.
In CZs, Thargoids generally have the behavior of target-locking the center of the combat zone after losing a target-lock and beginning a search for a new target. Their scripts are not perfect, and they do sometimes still wake-out even when they’re only a few kilometers from the combat zone.

### When the Thargoid is Fast

One method to disengage a Thargoid is to kite the Thargoid toward NPCs, have them engage the Thargoid, while staying cold. This would be making use of Thargoid aggro mechanics and AX Pilots, Rescue ships, or whatever NPCs there are in your instance.
In a solo instance, when the Thargoid is faster than you, there is no chance for disengagement
from the Thargoid without using the FSD to wake-out.

## Unwanted Hyperdictions and Interdictions

When planning operations in or near Thargoid statused systems, hyperdictions and interdictions are inevitable. While there are special cases; the efficient method is to do the following steps as soon as possible:
1. Enter Silent Running,
1. Boost away from radar contacts,
1. Ensure Engine Capacitor has 4 pips,
1. Heatsink to avoid module damage, then,
1. Charge FSD when cooldown is complete and continue your flight plan.

### Special Case: Scouts

In addition to boosting away from the radar contacts, a large diameter barrel roll should be practiced. Scouts engage their victims and begin firing almost immediately. The addition of a barrel roll with the boost will continuously move the vessel out of the way of incoming scout fire. Successive interdictions by scouts would normally aggregate to significant hull damage, wherein a pilot utilizing a barrel roll can minimize the damage taken, possibly to zero.

> A Barrel Roll is NOT simply a roll. But, it is easy enough to perform using the simple combination of lats/verts and gentle roll inputs. {.is-info}

### Special Case: When the Thargoid is Fast

Straight line speed is a great advantage but not necessary to evade Thargoid aggressors. This is another case where understanding the fundamentals of cold-orbiting can be quite helpful. Maintaining a cold orbit until the FSD cooldown completes, will minimize damage. During FSD charging:
1. Allow the Thargoid to slowly approach with some vertical thrust as if setting up another orbit,
1. Boost away from the Thargoid on its "rearm" phase,
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 until FSD finishes charging

### Special Case: Glaives

Glaives are bullies. There are a few tricks to dealing with them in unwanted hyper/inter-dictions.

Upon entering the instance, just like any other Thargoid, there is an element of RNG whether the Glaive will be targeted to you. If it is facing askew or the wrong way, then there’s more time to get a head start running. If your ship passes into alignment with the Glaive, it will gain an immediate target lock. The Glaive will maneuver into engagement distance to begin combat. If it gets within combat engagement range, it will fire its containment missile.


If your ship boosts over 520 m/s and can boost every 7 seconds; then, with good RNG and repeated boosts, the ship should be capable of keeping the Glaive just out of combat engagement range in order to safely wake-out.

If your ship is not capable of an average speed () while boosting, then a contingency plan should be adopted. If hardpoints are a flexible option, choose the pre-engineered overcharged AX enhanced multicannons with autoloader and destroy the Glaive, for an easy bundle of credits and materials. Be aware that the Glaive has other special attacks that can be devastating to the unprepared. The ECM module can affect the FSD reboot missile, making running an option for the average speed ships. Slow ships have no chance of outrunning the Glaive, which leaves only three options; fight, die, or combat log.
