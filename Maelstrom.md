# Thargoid Maelstrom

> This page is a work in progress

The Thargoid Maelstrom is a new type of instance that appeared alongside the Thargoid Invasion in Nov 3308. These instances have appeared in several systems and are an incredibly dangerous anomaly which purpose is currently unknown. All 8 UIA causing the Maelstroms impacted.

You can view current Maelstrom systems in the AXI tracking site: [Thargoid Watch](https://www.antixenoinitiative.com/watch)

## Maelstrom Cloud

The Thargoid Maelstrom is a large cloud-like area, these appear similar to Lagrange clouds. Travelling inside the cloud will incur significant caustic damage and it is ill advised to travel within the cloud without preparations. The cloud is an area of swarming lightning storms and various Thargoid-related anomalies. Caustic Generators can be seen floating in the cloud and are most likely the source of the caustic damage area.

Outer radius: 115km (Sensor interference begins)
Intermediate radius: 79km (Caustic and tidal effects begin -and get progressively worse the further in one goes-; caustic generators and free-floating Caustic Shards and Caustic Crystals are present)
Repulsion field radius: 55km (Trigger repulsion field at this range)
Inner cloud radius: Uknown, presumed to be 45km or fewer

The center of the Maelstrom is a large red-ish cloud, approaching the center will cause a large EMP-like pulse to emit from the Center which will eject any ships at a high velocity, shutting them down and damaging them in the process.

## Caustic Generators

These generators are also heat based Mines, these mines when detecting heat slowly drift towards ship and then explode, causing a 3km caustic explosion with a knock-back effect. Current safe heat threshold is unknown and subject to further testing.

These Caustic generators are checked on by Thargoid Interceptors flying about within the Maelstrom, these Interceptors are typically passive however become hostile within a certain range, this is still being researched and may not be completely accurate.

Destroying a Caustic Generator will cause it to drop various materials which can be collected. These materials appeared to be used in caustic sink synthesis, although the synthesis was quietly patched out of game.

Individual caustic sinks last 43 seconds in minimal caustic (just inside the perimeter) and 27 seconds 20km deep inside perimeter. Ammo-capacity engineer Caustic Sinks Launchers thus provide approximately 4-6 minutes of protection each, not including ammo synthesis (which is possible, but expensive in terms of materials.)

## System Wide Impact

When in the same system as a Thargoid Maelstrom, Guardian Modules are functionally unusable and will decay while anywhere in the system at a constant rate.  
Guardian weapons, Guardian Module Reinforcement, and Guardian Shield Reinforcement decay at a rate of 1%/s.  
The Guardian Power Plant and Guardian Power Distributor decay at a rate of 1% every 10 seconds, but do not decay lower than 19%.  
The Guardian Hull Reinforcement is immune, because it does not have integrity of its own.
