<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This page contains a list of “cursed builds” I or others have used, or tried to use, in AX combat, with varying degrees of success. It is not intended for beginners, and is not intended for general purpose use - as many of these are min/maxed builds that can do little else besides the one fight they were designed for.</p>
<p>Throughout these examples, I will also try to explain the concepts and principles which went into their (often highly unconventional) designs.</p>
<h1>Adder: Hydra-capable “Apex Shuttle”</h1>

<p>Build and combat notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Armed Apex Shuttle that proved (barely) capable of solo'ing a Thargoid Hydra.</li>
  <li>Needs 1/1/4 pips to work, and a WF5/SC distro to avoid heat spikes, making orbiting in it quite challenging - as the Adder maneuvers poorly on just 1 ENG PIP. (A CE5/SC or even CE5/CC distro spikes quite high, resulting in a lot of damage taken. The 1 PIP in SYS is required to fire the necessary amount of sinks, as a WF5 distro doesn't have enough SYS capacity to fire all 10 without recharging)</li>
  <li>The 716hp hull provides very little in terms of buffer - this is effectively a necro build as 4 limpets will repair all the way up to 100% in between runs, while doing so in less than the shield decay timer of a Hydra (5m19s.)</li>
  <li>On the flip side, module protection is excellent; AFMU use is typically minimal.</li>
  <li>Expect a synth-heavy fight if using this ship (ammo, limpets, sinks, some afmu.)</li>
  <li>Highly recommend flying with an empty cargo hold and synthesizing limpets as needed (and dumping any extra ones before engaging) - the penalty for extra tons of weight is very significant on this ship (~4 m/s per ton orbiting velocity)</li>

<p>Build and combat notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ah, the king of cursed builds. Buy a chieftain, and kit it with the absolute worst-in-slot-options for any given module category (typically E-rated.) Forget about engineering. Then take it for a spin, and learn how much a MetaChief has hidden all your skill issues to-date.</li>
  <li>This ship is maybe the very best ship to learn and practice in. It will not carry you in any way shape or form. And yet it has been proven to be Hydra-solo-capable.</li>
  <li>This build actually orbits decently (for a cursed build), and has the benefit of not spiking heat at all. It's major (and, I mean, MAJOR) limitation is its speed. You will struggle for the entire duration of the fight to create distance / separation from the goid - learning to use goid rearm with your rare boost to get just barely outside of range, and for a very short time.</li>

<p>Build and combat notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>This IEagle is the absolute fastest optimized AX combat build I've ever designed; both the ViperMk3 and the iCourier, notably fast ships, are significantly slower than the IEagle in an AX combat configuration. The Hauler, using 1-4-1, can orbit slightly faster, but its boost is notably slower.</li>
  <li>As a matter of fact, it can be argued that the iEagle may be even TOO fast; orbiting in the iEagle requires taking care at not going TOO FAST (you can outrun the goid's top speed with your laterals alone!), which is not something you need to worry about in any other ship</li>
  <li>The ship orbits quite well overall and is almost as responsive as a Ship Launched Fighter; It's a really fun ship to fly …</li>
  <li>… except for its one major, CRIPPLING issue: its single utility slot</li>
  <li>Having a single utility means that A) You can't double-sink to power anything bigger than 3 small gauss; and B) Your sink coverage time is at most 50 seconds (with a CG sink.)</li>
  <li>Now you will realize WHY that is an absolutely titanic problem, when you compare your sink coverage time (50s) with a Hydra first heart exert MTToT (60s) … the implication is that, put simply, you will run out of sinks on the first 3-4 hearts of a Hydra. You will need to combat-synth sinks to try and avoid that. Needless to say, combat-synthing sinks with an active 128-thargon swarm, while trying to keep a high fire rate and ideal range on a Hydra is … exceptionally hard</li>
  <li>I have not managed to get past Heart 2 on a Hydra with this build myself … such a fight remains on the list of near-impossible kills</li>
  <li>On the other hand, fighting a Dusa is quite doable, and a very fun and interesting challenge with this ship</li>

<p>Build and combat notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>My personal take on the general build created and popularized by CMDR ckhrix (UAAR); much of the theorycrafting behind this build is actually from him, notably the Engine-focused power distributor (I believe this is the ONLY AX build to sport such an unconventional PD.)</li>
  <li>This build is notable as a single active heatsink (which produce +2 MW of WEP power for 10 seconds each, at a one-time cost of 2 MJ of SYS Cap energy) can power the single small gauss cannon that the ship can equip - freeing up the ship to fly in a 1/4/1 PIP configuration in combat. The result is an incredibly nimble and fast small ship, which can essentially permaboost using its little engine-focused distro (7.8 seconds boost cycle) noting that, even without boost, you can sustain an extremely high 466 m/s unladen orbital velocity</li>
  <li>What this ship has in terms of speed and maneuverability, it lacks in terms of firepower and tank - limiting its use to lower goid variants (unless in a wing) and making it quite fragile should you accidentally find yourself in a goid's crosshairs while not under sink coverage</li>
  <li>One additional positive note is that, given this ship is already at minimum weight, it is possible to give the ship a functional FSD and a proper-sized fuel tank without compromise combat performance. The result is a ship which isn't just able to fight, but can also conveniently move around various systems with a decent ~28 LY jump distance, and ~135 LY laden jump range.</li>
  <li>This build allows for arguably the easiest “Vanguard” challenge kill, as a simple cyclops is sufficient for said task, and the MTToT of this ship (using premium ammo) on a Clops is a meager 16 seconds (and, even with basic ammo, it is still a manageable 25 seconds.)</li>
  <li>This ship and it's distant cousin the sidewinder are also the only two ship types allowed for “The Swarm” challenge rank; something 4 of these little ships are very well suited to handle</li>
  <li>Finally, maybe the most notable and rare kill done in this ship is a solo Basilisk fight. Such fight has one of the highest MTToTs among even the most elite combat situations, at 64 seconds (with premium ammo.) It is a kill originally demonstrated by CMDR Maligno, and one very few CMDRs have emulated to-date.</li>
</ul>
