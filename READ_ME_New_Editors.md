# Welcome, Editor!

Thank you for requesting permissions to edit the AXI wiki!

There are a few guiding priciples we want all of our editors to be familiar with before beginning their hardwork.

The following section is written to provide examples of thoughtfullness desired in our editors as well as provide direction to some immediate work that could be done to improve the AXI wiki.

# Organization Driven Change and Principles

We want to be in agreement before restructuring the wiki so please check with AXI staff before adding, moving, or removing sections.

When planning a page edit, if there is a "primary editor" of a page, check with them as a courtesy before committing changes. In example, Airom has done a bunch of work on the recommended builds, Mechan created the cursed builds page, etc. Please communicate with them first about your ideas.

If your changes include adding new web assets (like images), then upload them to the wiki first instead of linking them, this way the wiki git repository has its own copy of the asset, hopefully preventing any elements from breaking over time.

https://wiki.antixenoinitiative.com is based on Node.js and Git under the requarks.io open source project.

The user experience for the information published by AXI can be inconsistent and difficult to navigate. To improve the user experience and accuracy of the information presented by AXI, clearly written goals and evaluations are proposed for the changes required to achieve the overall goal of providing to the community an effective and consicely written primary repository of AXI related articles. Fixing typos and grammatical mistakes are always expected of every recommendation for changes and is thusly not mentioned going forward.


The following Webpages section is formatted; 

[Page Name and link]()
  - Webpage short description
  - Webpage's intended goals
  - An evaluation of whether the webpage achieves its goals, and
  - Any recommendations for changes.

Webpages
-------------

[Home page](/en/home):
- Introduction to the AXI wiki
- Provides immediate direction to the audience what to expect from and how to use this wiki, a logical starting place for the new user, quicklinks for high-priority popular topics, and an invitation to contribute to the wiki.
- Instructions for how to use this wiki are unclear
- Adding a section to explain page navigation and maybe express that several features appear on every page that the average user cannot utilize could help to proactively set user expectations. For example, who can comment on any given page.

[Read Me for New Editors](/en/READ_ME_New_Editors): 
- Introduction for users that have been granted editing permissions
- This page needs to lay ground rules for editorial work and also lay out some kind of organizational plan so future iterations of AXI webpages are effective and useful.
- It's currently in its first revision and could use input from everyone
- An exhaustive list could be produced for all the webpages and could use the evaluation/recommendation treatment. Perhaps a section on Staff members could be explicitly provided so that the above instruction, "check with AXI staff" can be clearly and completely understood.

[Thargoids](/en/Thargoids):
- Introduction to the Thargoid xenos
- Introduce the average pilot to Thargoids; provide context to the audience "so what's a Thargoid and what does it have to do with me?" Provide references for the interested audience to study Thargoids in greater detail
- the page does not succeed in "what does it have to do with me" but indirectly provides an overview, that they are dangerous, humanity has develeped x, and pilots can fight them. 
- A section could be written to follow up "the Thargoids are a nonhuman race with a history of hostility towards humanity" to the effect of "we are at war... pilots that choose to attempt combat with Thargoids are rewarded for their bravery... AXI Ranks for distinguishing accomplished combatants, etc."
