# Spire Operations
Spires are planetside structures in specific thargoid controlled systems, guarded by Banshee skimmers (which fire pulse missiles at ships within a few kilometers), and featuring frequent Orthrus class interceptors launching from and descending to the structures.

## Why do we go there?

Spire operations offer great synergy for personal benefit and for the wider thargoid war effort.
   
-   **Winning the war** - Spire sites are logistics bases for the thargoids.  Combat there affects the thargoids' war effort.  Directly, thargoid kills at active spire sites reduce the influence of thargoid Titans on the 10 outermost systems under the Titan's control, to a maximum of 85% recaptured, or if the sysem with the spire in it is one of those ten, it can be 100% recaptured with spire operations.  Other methods of recapturing systems are far less effective and only affect one system at a time.  With the forthcoming changes in patch 18.05 the limit of 10 systems is anticipated to be removed, meaning spire operations will be even more strategically important.
    
-   **Making credits** - Spire operations can offer substantial credit rewards.  Even with the reduction in combat bonds introduced in patch 18.05 reducing combat bonds from destroying Orthrus interceptors from 40 million to 15 million, it's possible to earn several hundred million credits per hour in an effective and organsied spire group. 

-   **Getting engineering materials** - Spire sabotage missions can also offer "Odyssey" (on-foot) engineering materials as rewards.

## What can I do at spire sites?

There are two major activities at spire sites, both of which significantly contribute to the war effort.
   
-   **Ship-based combat** - Destroying thargoid craft at spire sites pushes back the war front from each Titan.  You will encounter large numbers of the passive Orthtrus interceptors, as well as other craft explained in detail below.
    
-   **Spire sabotage** - An Odyssey (on-foot) activity which requires gathering materials and taking missions from Rescue Megaships to poison parts of the four spires, destroying them and causing waves of powerful thargoid interceptors to spawn.

## Thargoids present at spire sites

Like any military logistics base, spire sites are patrolled and guarded by a variety of defenders.  You can expect to see some form of resistance to attack from the air and the ground.  Enemies you will encounter will normally consist of:
   
-   **Revenant** - A small (infantry-level) thargoid combat drone.  Revenants can be damaged with hand-held weapons.
    
-   **Banshee** - A thargoid surface craft, equivalent in size and capability to a human skimmer.  Eight will be present in each instance when first entered.  Banshees fire missiles which cause short-term shutdowns to human ship systems, as well as homing mines which detonate shortly after attaching, and a forward facing cannon.  They have limited flight capability and can be destroyed with ship-based and on-foot weapons.  For ship-based combat it is possible to clear out banshees from an instance and "hold it open" by ensuring the instance remains occupied by one CMDR whilst another resupplies.  Banshees will eventually respawn but only in instances which have been running for extensive periods of time (around 12 hours).

-   **Scout** - Scout packs will spawn in occasionally when summoned by a thargoid under attack, and also each time an interceptor wakes out after being attacked, or emits a shutdown field.

-   **Orthrus** - A thargoid logistics ship, used to transporting resources and other general support activities. Whilst they have no direct offensive capabilities, their defensive shutdown fields and anti-guardian fields can be disruptive.  

-   **Cyclops** - Cyclops can occasionally be summoned y an under-attack orthrus instead of a pack of scouts.

-   **Basilisk** - A basilisk can spawn if someone is undertaking spire sabotage.

-   **Medusa** - A pack of medusas will spawn if a spire is completely sabotaged.

## Ship-based combat roles

The general principle of ship-based combat is to destroy as many Orthrus as you can, as quickly as you can.  This is best achieved in a wing with the capability to counter any of the potential threats on-site.  This will include the following roles:
   
-   **Bomber** - A ship with anti-Xeno missiles can make short work of the banshees and also provide strong damage to interceptor shields and hulls.
    
-   **Fighter** - A ship with anti-Xeno multi-cannons can effectively deal with the scouts which spawn regularly and, whilst individually a mere nusiance, can in numbers become a problem.

-   **Heavy weapons** - A ship with a good power plant and distributor can bring guardian weapons to bear, which are particularly effective against thargoid interceptors but are vulnerable to the orthrus' anti-guardian field.  Guardian weapons need to be either engineered by Ram Tah to be able to withstand this, or you will need to bring an auto field maintenance unit to repair them from time to time.  

-   **Support** - A ship with a large hold full of limpets and a repair limpet controller is always welcome at a spire site.  There is also a limited role for a ship with conconrdant and regeneration sequence lasers, as shielded builds are not common at spire sites.
