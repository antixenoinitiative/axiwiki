# Spire Operations
Spires are planetside structures in specific thargoid controlled systems, guarded by Banshee skimmers (which fire pulse missiles at ships within a few kilometers), and featuring frequent Orthrus class interceptors launching from and descending to the structures.

## Why do we go there?

Spire operations offer great synergy for personal benefit and for the wider thargoid war effort.
   
-   **Winning the war** - Spire sites are logistics bases for the thargoids.  Combat there affects the thargoids' war effort.  Directly, thargoid kills at active spire sites reduce the influence of thargoid Titans on the 10 outermost systems under the Titan's control, to a maximum of 85% recaptured, or if the sysem with the spire in it is one of those ten, it can be 100% recaptured with spire operations.  Other methods of recapturing systems are far less effective and only affect one system at a time.  With the forthcoming changes in patch 18.05 the limit of 10 systems is anticipated to be removed, meaning spire operations will be even more strategically important.
    
-   **Making credits** - Spire operations can offer substantial credit rewards.  Even with the reduction in combat bonds introduced in patch 18.05 reducing combat bonds from destroying Orthrus interceptors from 40 million to 15 million, it's possible to earn several hundred million credits per hour in an effective and organsied spire group. 

-   **Getting engineering materials** - Spire sabotage missions can also offer "Odyssey" (on-foot) engineering materials as rewards.

## What can I do at spire sites?

There are two major activities at spire sites, both of which significantly contribute to the war effort.
   
-   **Ship-based combat** - Destroying thargoid craft at spire sites pushes back the war front from each Titan.  You will encounter large numbers of the passive Orthtrus interceptors, as well as other craft explained in detail below.
    
-   **Spire sabotage** - An Odyssey (on-foot) activity which requires gathering materials and taking missions from Rescue Megaships to poison parts of the four spires, destroying them and causing waves of powerful thargoid interceptors to spawn.
