# Build Repository

There are many different ways to build an Anti-Xeno Ship. The **AXI Ship Build Repository** is a detailed collection of all builds created and submitted by CMDRs of the AXI to be shared among pilots. These builds are curated by the Staff team before being published to ensure quality and accuracy. If you have any concerns about these builds, please contact a staff member.

> Many builds in the repository are outdated, please be aware and turn to the [Recommended Builds](/en/builds) page first.
