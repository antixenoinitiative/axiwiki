# Recommended Builds
Anti-Xeno operations require specialised ship builds as Thargoids have special resistances and deal special damage types that will typically render a standard combat build useless.
As such, we have put together the following recommendations to help and lead you towards choosing and building the most effective ship for hunting down Thargoid vessels, for you.
These ship builds are designed to maximize firepower and survivability, allowing any commander, regardless of skill level, to achieve victory.

> Please see our [Ship Build Theory](/en/shipbuildtheory) page for a more in-depth explanation on AX ship building.
{.is-info}

## Ship Build Types

There are a variety of builds for Anti-Xeno combat. More specialized technology is usually required for more hostile locations and activities.

These are the currently available AX combat activities, and the builds for them:
- **Solo Builds** - One commander, one (or more) interceptors. These builds form the **core basis of all other builds**, and you should always start here.
- **Anti-Xeno Conflict Zone (AXCZ) Builds** - These builds are solo builds with various modifications to make them better suited for fighting in groups. Group AX presents a few hazards which usually aren't seen in solo fights.


# Recommended Solo Builds

These builds are designed for **solo combat**, meaning one commander engaged with one or more interceptors. These form the core of all other builds and are the best starting point.

Thargoid Interceptors are **very tough and powerful enemies** that will require equally strong ships to be able to stand a chance in combat. Due to the incredibly high damage output of Thargoid Interceptors, there are only a handful of different styles and methods you can use effectively.

There is one style that we specificly recommend due to it's effectiveness and ease of use:
-   **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage. **Generally recommended for all skill levels.**

When starting out, stick to the tried and true. These are our Meta picks. The most effective AX platforms for learners and experienced AX pilots alike:


  ## Tabset {.tabset}

  
  
  ### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)
  ![alliance-chieftain.png](/img/alliance-chieftain.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

  The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.
  
  Unarguably the best ship and build style for learning AX combat.

  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)**

  The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any guardian weapon effectively (when dropping Flak). This is also a great platform for mounting Enhanced AXMCs for commanders who do not yet have access to guardian tech.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Shield: 
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Also great for modified shard cannons and plasma chargers.

  Engineering Note: Can comfortably use the same power plant as meta chieftain or even unengineered 6A or 7A, depending on your preferences between power priorities, speed and material or rebuy cost. Check EDSY for minimum engineering based on your specific build.

  ### Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)
  ![alliance-challenger.png](/img/alliance-challenger.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)**

  The Alliance Challenger, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower alternative with higher damage output against an interceptor’s shields. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build.
  Its three medium hardpoints with good convergence make it a better platform for running modified Shard Cannons or Plasma Chargers, hence it is a popular option for AXCZ's as well.

  A great ship for those who find the Chieftain too responsive, or want to use shards or chargers.

  ### Corsair (Shieldless)
  ![corsair.png](/img/corsair.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Corsair (Shieldless)**

  The Corsair, while not as maneuverable as the chief or challenger, provides great damage output, versatility and speed. The Corsairs' massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any guardian weapon effectively. It is the recommended medium with the most survivability. This is also a great platform for mounting Enhanced AXMCs for commanders who do not yet have access to guardian tech.

# Anti-Xeno Conflict Zone Builds
Because of the presence of variables outside one's control (NPCs, other Players) and with more Thargoid enemies on the field at once, certain modules are recommended to deal with stray special attacks, fire and effects. Most Solo builds can be refitted slightly to incorporate these modules, to get a ship well-equipped for AXCZ's.

 ### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)
  ![alliance-chieftain.png](/img/alliance-chieftain.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

  While the Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta in solo, the gauss cannons that are so heavily favored by its hardpoint layout do leave some Ammo capacity to be desired. However the  Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit and, especially with closeby re-arms, will still be 
immensely effective.

## Module Recommendations
- **Shutdown Field Neutralizer** - Interceptors fire an unavoidable Shutdown Pulse upon entering the AXCZ, for which you'll need an SFN.
- **Higher Ammo and carrying Capacity** - AXCZs can take extended periods of time, and not always will you have the option of a nearby re-fill or leaving the instance without losing progress. Choose weapons accordingly if possible.
- **Flakless** - Swarm behavior is often unpredictable in space AXCZs, and there are none in planetary AXCZs. Dropping flak for more firepower is recommended.

### Suggested Extra Modules
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Caustic missiles are more common, and Scouts & Interceptors leave caustic clouds behind when they die. Caustic sinks are a great way to deal with caustic damage, especially for beginners. Overheating is also a viable option to remove caustic effects, experienced pilots or utility limited ships can drop these.
- **Enhanced Xeno Scanner** - Lets you see thargoid health and type, as well as allowing you to scan Interceptors for heart sub-targeting. **Sub-targeting is required to hit hearts with gimballed multi-cannons.**
- **Additional AFMU capacity** - Commanders may find value in increasing their AFMU capacity or by installing an additional one for faster repairs. But be warned that this will always come as a tradeoff when giving up the module slot.
  

## Scout Builds

Scout killers hold a supportive role in Anti-Xeno Conflict Zones. They can also be used to farm thargoid materials or gain combat rank.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Optionally Decent Shields
- As many Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons as you can fit
- Caustic Sink Launchers


# Advanced Builds

Some build-types are more difficult to wield than others. They are **best used with some prior AX experience** or deeper fundamentals in Elite (PvP) combat.

There are also off-meta build-variants which are more custom tailored to the needs and preferences of experienced pilots. You may find some of them in the repository.

> We typically do not recommend builds from this category to beginners looking to improve in AX.
{.is-warning}

## Large Builds

Flying a large AX ship is often a net disadvantage compared to meta mediums in open fielded combat, but you can still use them at your own discretion, their main types are:

- **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically. Harder to use in open-field combat than meta mediums.

- **Slow Shieldless Builds** - Slow ships without shields. These especially are simply outclassed by more effective mediums.

> Specific large ship builds are used in Stunlocking, a [speedrunning](https://wiki.antixenoinitiative.com/en/combat-speedrunning) technique. View [speedrunning builds](https://wiki.antixenoinitiative.com/en/speedrunbuilds).
{.is-info}

These ships offer different flight characteristics, new hardpoint setups and generally some variety, while requiring more experience to use effectively. If you intend to use any of these, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.

  #### **Federal Corvette (Shieldless)**

  One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.
  
  An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

  One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed.

  ### Imperial Cutter (Shielded)
  ![imperial-cutter.png](/img/imperial-cutter.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Imperial Cutter (Shielded)**

  If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage.
  
  Different fighting style and generally very capable with weaker Interceptors. Becomes much harder for tougher variants.
