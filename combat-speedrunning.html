<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>First things first: Speedrunning is not for newcomer pilots to Anti-Xeno combat.</p>
<p>We generally recommend CMDRs attain at least the Serpent’s Nemesis rank (Medusa solo) before they focus on learning the advanced techniques involved in speedrunning.</p>
<h1>Speedrunning Ranks</h1>
<p>There are two ranks associated with speed kills: Myrmidon and Caduceus’ Glint</p>
<h2>Myrmidon - “Silver” color</h2>
<p>Myrmidon is the “Vanguard” equivalent rank for speedrunning kills. Whereas Vanguard requires you to do a complex or off-meta kill, but gives you no time limit, Myrmidon allows you to use a meta ship, but gives you a strict time limit.</p>
<p>Time limits, for a solo Medusa kill,are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>24’00’’000’’’ - Small Ship</li>
  <li>12’00’’000’’’ - Medium Ship</li>
  <li>6’00’’000’’’ - Large Ship</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cadeceus’ Glint - “Gold” color</h2>
<p>Caduceus’ glint, or glint for short, is the “Ace” equivalent for speedrunning kills. It is one of only two “competitive” ranks - as in, you can lose this rank.</p>
<p>Only up to 9 glint CMDRs can exist at any one point, and typically (because a CMDR can hold a record in more than one category) there will be fewer than 9.</p>
<p>Glint is awarded for the fastest small/medium/large ship kill on Basilisk, Medusa, and Hydra. Cyclops do NOT award a Glint rank.</p>

<h1>Speedrunning Theory</h1>
<p>Speedrunning is about killing a Thargoid in the shortest amount possible, without resorting to bugs or unintended mechanics (e.g., “gibbing”).</p>
<p>In order to get started, the first thing you’ll want to understand is the detailed behavior of Goid AI upon heart distruction. Understanding this is critical to avoid triggering “panic shields”:</p>
