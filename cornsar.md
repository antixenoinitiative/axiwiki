# The Cornsar System Thargoid Attack
On the 16th of September 3307 the Cornsar system came under attack by Thargoids, damaging multiple stations and sending the system into chaos. The following page details the timeline of events and actors involved.

## 14th September 3307

The mysterious actor known as "Salvation" publicly makes a prediction of an upcoming Thargoid Attack to Galnet.

**Galnet Report - 14th September 3307**
> The anonymous figure known as Salvation claims that Thargoid forces will shortly launch an assault in the Cornsar system.
> 
> The following message was received by all major newsfeeds:
> 
> “This is Salvation. Authorities in the Cornsar system must evacuate the local population immediately. I believe a Thargoid invasion of the system is imminent.”
> 
> “I became aware of this danger while developing a new interstellar xeno-detection network, which will be far superior to Eagle Eye. Although the network is not fully complete, we cannot dismiss this report as a false reading. Cornsar must act now.”
> 
> Carter Armstrong, a chief administrator with Aegis, delivered an official statement:
> 
> “Aegis cannot validate this claim. There is no indication of a Thargoid presence in the vicinity, and Cornsar is too far from their known territories to be a viable target. As most of our operations are suspended due to the public inquiry, we cannot dedicate any resources to investigate further.”
> 
> There was also a response from Marshal Noah Sharrow, who governs the Cornsar system on behalf of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party:
> 
> “We have no interest in the games of one-upmanship between Aegis and Salvation. Nor do we believe for a moment that the Thargoids would go out of their way to harass us.”

## 16th September 3307

Thargoid attacks are detected in the Cornsar System as predicted by "Salvation". Two stations are heavily damaged. No AXCZs are found in the system.

- **Chadwick Port** [Cornsar]
- **Ito Market** [Cornsar]

**Galnet Report - 16th September 3307**
> *Pilots Federation ALERT*
> 
> The Cornsar system has been attacked by Thargoid forces, causing severe damage to two starports.
> 
> Direct assaults against Chadwick Port and Ito Market stations have resulted in over ten thousand casualties. Local reports state that Thargoid vessels have also appeared elsewhere throughout the system, placing millions more lives at risk.
> 
> The anonymous figure known as Salvation recently warned that Cornsar was in imminent danger of being invaded, having been alerted by his new xeno-detection network. Aegis could not verify Salvation’s claim and saw no evidence of any Thargoid presence.
> 
> The system’s ruler, Marshal Noah Sharrow of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party, transmitted this message:
> 
> “This is a call to any pilots in the vicinity of Cornsar. We urgently need ships to defend our people from the Thargoids, and to rescue civilians trapped within Chadwick Port and Ito Market. This is a grave emergency!”
> 
> Aegis has released a brief statement:
> 
> “We can confirm there is a Thargoid presence in the Cornsar system. Unfortunately most of our operations and personnel remain suspended due to the public inquiry, so we cannot contribute to any anti-xeno efforts.”
> 
> There has been no further communication from Salvation, despite his accurate prediction of the attack.

### Non-Human Signal Sources

Pilots note that the Non-Human Signal Sources in the Cornsar System do not behave in the usual manner found in other systems. NHSS in Cornsar are instead marked as "Points of Interest" instead of "Signal Sources".

Points of Interest act as global instances, which exist for all players at the same time, similar to a station or megaship. This means that the NHSS exist permanatly and do not despawn when all pilots have left the instance. These POI NHSS instances also respawn the Thargoid Interceptors and Scouts when the instance has been cleared approximately 5 mins after.

### Conflict Aftermaths
Pilots in the Cornsar system notice an abundance of "Conflict Aftermath" instances, these typically contain damaged ships and normal materials, however in the Cornsar system these are found to contain various Guardian Materials, such as:

- Guardian Power Cells
- Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts
- Guardian Wrackage Components
- Guardian Power Conduits
- Guardian Technology Components

## 17th September 3307
Various Pilots recieve a message from the actor known as "Salvation".

> You have performed well in my service before, and now i require your help again. This is an urgent matter, with millions of lives at risk. 
> 
> I ask you to travel to the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system immediately. There you will find the megaship Heart of Taurus, operated by my partners at Taurus Mining Ventures. From there you must collect basic medicines, and deliver them to either of the rescue ships in the Cornsar system. They need to arrive betore Monday the 20th of September if they are to be of use.
> 
> I am trusting you with the knowledge that these shipments have been disguised as medicines. but actually contain vital components for a prototype anti xeno weapon. With enough deliveries, I may be able to eliminate the Thargoid fleet currently causing havoc in Cornsar.
> 
> Naturally. I offer generous compensation for this tan On Thursday the 23rd of September you will be granted a permit to enter the Mbooni system where another megaship, the Bright Sentinel. will have a module waiting for you in storage. This is a modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Cannon with increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range.
> 
> As you know, we cannot rely on Aegis to save us from the Thargoids. Only I am capable of achieving this, and courageous pilots like you can ensure my triumph.

This was later followed by another message sent out by the "Heart of Taurus" Megaship to all ships in the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system.

> SYSTEM BROADCAST FROM HEART OF TAURUS MEGASHIP
> A message from Taurus Mining Ventures to all ships in the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system.
> 
> This is Captain Chae-Won Lee, commanding the Heart of Taurus. Our company has been Contracted by Salvation to spearhead an operation against the Thargoids.
> 
> All independent pilots are requested to dock with this Megaship. to collect as many units of basic medicines as possible. The cargo needs to be delivered to either of the rescue ships in the Corns. System. It is Imperative that these deliveries are made before Monday me 20th of September.
> 
> These commodities are registered as medicinal goods to minimize inspection by the Cornsar authorities. but In truth contain advanced technical components. Individually the shipments have little value, but sufficient quantities of them will enable Salvation's prototype anti-xeno weapon to become operational.
> 
> Taurus Mining Ventures has been authorized to reward those who support this initiative. Providing you have delivered the requested cargo. you will be granted entry to the permit-locked Mbooni system on Thursday the 23rd of September.
> 
> A modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Cannon, which has increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range, will be offered as payment This will be waiting for you in storage at our sister ship, the Bright Sentinel.
> 
> On behalf of Salvation, I wish you good luck.

## 20th September 3307
All NHSS Signal sources in the Cornsar system vanish, at the same time pilots notice the sudden appearance of "Crashed Thargoid Ships" on the surfaces of bodies in the system.

"Salvation" appears to have kept to their promise of "Eliminating" the Thargoids in the system.
