# Nichtmenschliche Signalquellen
Non-Human Signal Sources are a special type of signal source that can be found in areas of Thargoid activity, Upon finding and entering a NHSS there is a chance you will get one of three outcomes:

- A single Thargoid Interceptor (Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa or Hydra)
- A swarm of scouts + a Thargoid Interceptor (Hostile)
- A swarm of scouts (Lower NHSS)

If you get option 2, the Thargoid Interceptor will emit an EMP pulse when it arrives and it will be immediately hostile

A NHSS can only be seen while in supercruise. Since they will often appear in bulk, to easily scan them all drop onto the Nav Beacon and scan it. Once you jump into supercruise all NHSS will be unveiled.

NHSS are dynamic and will appear and disappear over time, lasting anywhere up to 30 minutes each.

In some rare cases (Threat 5-8 only) you will have an empty instance with only damaged ships, in these instances there is a chance you may find a Thargoid Probe or a Thargoid Sensor.

See this investigation into NHSS spawn rates and possible instances: [NHSS Spawn Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRbZ2vWwaUPZlSx9Olg8o8Ml0xGVXQ8Ks7wtYycWfXymCZjn30tvP76fc5ACM1mx_O0ZvYBqI6VW3sa/pubhtml)

The Anti-Xeno Initiative recommends Asterope in the Pleiades Nebula as one of the best Thargoid hunting systems in the game.

- The system always has a large number of NHSS.
- Most of the NHSS spawn around the main star and the single station orbiting that star.
- There are no other planetary bodies or gravity wells to slow you down.

## Threat Level
Depending on the Threat Level of the NHSS you will find different types of Interceptors or more Scouts. Understanding this is key to finding the Thargoids you’re after for solo attempts.

Threat Levels:

- **[Bedrohung 2]** - 1x Thargoidsonde
- **[Bedrohung 3]** - 2x Scouts
- **[Bedrohung 4]** - 4-7x Scouts oder 1-2x Menschliche Schiffe + 4-7x Scouts (normalerweise 4 Scouts)
- **[Bedrohung 5]** - 1x Cyclops oder 4-8x Scouts
- **[Bedrohung 6]** - 1x Basilisk oder 1x Cyclops + 4x Scouts
- **[Bedrohung 7]** - 1x Medusa oder 1x Basilisk + 4x Scouts
- **[Bedrohung 8]** - 1x Hydra* oder 1x Medusa + 4x Scouts
- **[Bedrohung 9]** - 1x Hydra + 4x Scouts

> Lone Hydras can only currently be found in the Coalsack Nebula. Every Threat 8 in the Pleiades Nebula or the Witch Head Nebula will contain 1x Medusa + 4x Scouts. **With one exception**: The system Pleiades Sector MI-S B4-0 contains Solo Hydras, present in both regular and guaranteed Threat 8 signal sources

## Guaranteed Interceptor Signals
If a NHSS has a **Salvage** icon next to it in the navigation panel, you will ALWAYS get a solo Interceptor based of the list above. For example, here is a guaranteed **Basilisk** signal source. Additionally, this instance is slightly different, as it only includes small debris and no green cloud. ![nhss.png](/img/nhss.png) Note: The small canister symbol on the left.
