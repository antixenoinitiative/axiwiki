## Maelstroms

Maelstroms were enormous hostile areas wrapped around Thargoid Titans during their major Invasion of the human bubble beginning in 3308 and lasting until the last Titans defeat at the end of 3310.

## Spire Sites

Spire Sites were huge organic structures, grown by the thargoids on planetary surfaces with faint atmospheres. They served as logistics bases for the thargoid armada during the Titan's invasion of the human bubble.
