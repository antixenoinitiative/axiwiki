# AX Waffen
Es gibt eine Vielzahl verschiedener Anti-Xeno-Waffen im Spiel, und sie sind in zwei Hauptvarianten erhältlich:

- **Menschliche AX Waffen** (AX Merfachgeschütz, AX Raketenrampe, Fortgeschrittene Mehrfachgeschütz, Fortgeschrittene Raketenrampe, Flakwerfer mit Fernzündung)
- **Guardian Weapons** (Guardian Gauss Cannon, Guardian Plasma Charger, Guardian Shard Cannon)

With the events of Salvation and the Thargoid Maelstroms, modified (pre-engineered) variants of all AX weapons have either been produced or are in development. As a whole, these are more viable and offer a wider meta for AX weapons. However, they must be purchased per-module, making them far more expensive than traditional guardian weaponry. For unlock costs on these new weapons, see [Inara's Tech Broker Page](https://inara.cz/elite/techbroker#tab_techbrokerslot3)

Guardian weapons are the most effective AX weapons in the game (specifically the Guardian Gauss Cannon) with human AX weapons being mostly unusable (with the exception of the Remote Release Flak Launcher).

Some builds will also include Thermal Vent Beam Lasers which allow pilots to easily reduce ship heat and avoid significant amounts of Thargoid fire. For more information, see Cold Orbiting and [Lasers](/en/lasers).

## **Weapon Options**
The currently best available weapons are the Remote Release Flak Launcher, Guardian Gauss Cannon, Modified Guardian Shard Cannon, and Modified Guardian Plasma Charger. For those who do not have guardian tech unlocked, the gimballed enhanced AX Multicannons are the best option, but these are only viable for Cyclops and scouts.

## Remote Release Flak Launcher

Derzeit die einzige wirksame Waffe gegen Thargon Schwärme.

**Empfohlen:** Ist ein Muss! (Benötigt um den Schwarm zu zerstören)

Hinweis: Zählt nicht in das Limit für 4 experimentelle Waffen.

## Guardian Gauss Cannon

Aktuell unangefochtene AX-Meta. Guardian Gauss Kanonen funktionieren wie eine Railgun mit einer kurzen Verzögerung, bevor sie feuern. Die schwere Rüstungsdurchdringung bietet hohe Effektivität, sogar gegen die stärksten Thargoids. Da es sie nur in kleinen und mittleren Größen gibt, bringt dies eine überraschende Ausgewogenheit zwischen den verschiedenen Schiffsklassen. Sie haben eine Reichweite von 3km. Der Leistungsverlust beginnt ab 1,5km, was einen guten Bereich für Präzisionsschläge gegen das Herz einräumt. Der einzige Nachteil ist die hohe Wärmeentwicklung, was den andauernden Gebrauch von Kühlkörpern nötig macht.

**Empfehlung:** Beste Anti-Xeno Waffe (Großartige Rüstungsdurchdringung, hohe Schadensleistung, Akkurat)

Hinweis: Bei Verwendung der Gauss Kanonen ist es wichtig, dass die Waffenaufhängungen gut aufeinander abgestimmt sind

## Modified Guardian Gauss Cannon

While the guardian gauss is similar to a railgun, the modified gauss are much like an imperial hammer, giving them their nickname "hammer gauss". These fire in a 4-round burst, with each shot dealing 25% of the normal damage. Overall, they are considered harder to use than stock gauss.

**Recommendation:** Do not use (Harder to aim, each gun costs materials)

## Guardian Shard Cannon

Similar to a Frag Cannon, very wide spread with only around a 700m effective range which means to be used effectively the pilot must fly within lightning range. While a potent weapon for speedrunning, the requirement of firing from within lightning range means that they are ineffective otherwise.

**Recommendation:** Do not use (Low effective range, Poor armour penetration)

## Modified Guardian Shard Cannon

These shard cannons come in medium and small variants. They have long range engineering and a higher armor penetration. They are a great alternative to gauss, offering a lot of the benefits of shard cannons but with lesser downsides.

**Recommendation:** Very good AX weapon (Very high DPS)

## Guardian Plasma Charger

Similar to a Plasma Accelerator, but poor armour penetration value makes it less effective against tougher Interceptors and difficulty to aim makes it bad for using on hearts. Damage dealt is also unpredictable.

**Recommendation:** Do not use (Poor armour penetration, Difficult to aim, Terrible capacitor draw)

## Modified Guardian Plasma Charger

These plasma chargers come in medium and small variants. They have greatly improved stats over stock chargers, with higher armor penetration, shot speed, and damage. While they struggle to deal damage to hearts, they are unrivaled in their exert capability.

**Recommendation:** Good AX weapon (Massive damage, Not effective against hearts)

## AX Multi-Cannon

AXMCs come in two types - Turreted and Fixed, and in two sizes - Medium and Large. The Large Turreted ones are the most effective Scout hunting weapon in the game, but the Large Fixed ones are only passable against the weakest Interceptor variant, the Cyclops, and the others are very ineffective.

**Recommendation:** Outclassed by Enhanced AXMCs

## Enhanced AX Multi-Cannon

These improved AXMCs currently only come in fixed, gimballed, and turreted forms. They come with a marginal increase to damage, as well as a large  increase in shot speed. Overall, they are only a small upgrade from regular AXMCs, but still better in all regards. The gimballed variants are the best, dealing nearly as much damage as fixed and coming with a great tracking arc. With a xeno scan, these can even be effective at killing cyclops.

**Recommendation:** Great for scouts, viable for cyclops

## AX Missile Rack

Okay, but very difficult to aim as they are slow moving and dumbfire only. Minimal ammo.

**Recommendation:** Do Not Use (Poor damage)

## Enhanced AX Missile Rack

Coming with only a marginal increase in damage and shot speed over standard AXMRs, these still deal no damage to hearts.

**Recommendation:** Do Not Use (Poor damage)

## Modified AX Missile Rack

These modified missile racks deal slightly less damage, but come with a greater fire rate and ammo cap. They still suffer from all of the downsides of missile racks, and have a very low armor piercing value.

**Recommendation:** Ok AX Weapon (Less damage than guardian weapons)

## Advanced Multi-Cannon

Same as a normal Multi-Cannon and can be engineered, however it will not do AX damage unless ammo is synthesized. Not to be confused with any variant of AXMCs.

**Recommendation:** Do not use (Poor damage, Cannot use without synth)

Note: Does not count against the 4 experimental weapon limit.

## Advanced Missile Racks

Similar to the Advanced Multi-Cannon, these are an engineerable clone of the normal Missile Rack which requires synth to deal AX damage. Due to their extreme splash damage, synth requirement, and lack of weapon number limit, they are banned from use in AXI ranks. Not to be confused with any variant of AXMRs.

**Recommendation:** Use at own discretion (Cannot use without synth, Banned from progression kills)

Note: Does not count against the 4 experimental weapon limit.
