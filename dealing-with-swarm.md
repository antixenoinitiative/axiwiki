# Dealing with the Swarm

The Thargon Swarm is a major component of most Thargoid Interceptors' kit. Knowing how to deal with it is important to combat Interceptors effectively.

This article contains several methods to deal with the swarm, but to fully grasp them it is advisable to learn the full mechanics and behavior of the swarm first.

> Visit the [Thargon Swarms](/en/thargon-swarms) page to learn how it functions in detail.

There are several ways to deal with the Swarm. Some are aimed at destroying the Swarm, but not all.

# Techniques & Counters

General methods of dealing with the Swarms behavior and mechanics.

## The Reverski

Traveling in a certain direction, in Flight Assist OFF, while having the ship face backwards.
A good and reliable maneuver to kite interceptors and their swarms.

**Passing the Interceptor to put the swarm between you and the interceptor.**

1. Turn FA-Off, face straight away from the interceptor, make sure the Interceptor is at the 180 degree mark on your Radar.

2. Transfer pips to ENG, throttle forwards and boost away.
Keep boosting until you are at the maximum range you can be without the Interceptor losing interest.
Typically around 6 - 7.5km in most ships.

3. Pitch to rotate your ship 180 degrees and face in the opposite direction of your movement vector.
You want to keep moving away while facing your pursuers, so make sure you do NOT accidently throttle forwards leadding you in the opposite direction now.

4. You can now fire your flak, beams or employ other techniques.
Keep an eye on your distance to the interceptor so it doesn't get too close.

## Missile Baiting

The safest and most effective way to un-agitate a Swarm and avoiding the missile-strike.

Easiest way to bait a swarm is to allow it to catch up (missile formation moves at around 360m/s when near firing range) and once it is within 3km missiles will begin to fire. Maintain distance of 2.5 - 2.9km reversing at around 300m/s and the missiles will expire before reaching you, most effectively done in "**reverski**".
Follow this up with a boost through the swarm after it reverts to a non-missile formation.

Mind that going beyond 3km range mid-missile barrage will interrupt it! Enter <2.9km range again to let the missile barrage finish before you boost through the Swarm!

## Swarm Rerolling

You can use the Interceptors recalling behavior to your advantage to reroll the current Swarm formation into a different one.
Move to a medium distance (depending on ship 4-6.5km) and stay cold via silent running or heatsinks, do not beam the Interceptor.
After a while the Interceptor should lose track of you, it will recall the swarm in preperation to leave. Wait until the Swarm gets close to its mothership, then gain back the attention of the interceptor by exiting silent-running, heating up or beaming it.

Make sure you act fast - you do not want the Interceptor to leave the Instance by waking out!

After you regained the attention the Swarm will change into an attack formation. It *can* roll the same as the previous one, but with any luck you rolled a new more desirable formation!

## Switching Interceptor and Swarm Position
In some cases, such as when the player is too far away from the Interceptor when the swarm is released (beyond 6km), the swarm will stay behind the Interceptor and engaging it will be impossible without taking fire from the Interceptor. To switch their positions, boost past the Interceptor (but not directly at it). Its inertia will cause it to drift away and take a long time to turn, while the swarm will make a much sharper turn.

# Destroying the Swarm

The only effective weapon against the Swarm is the remote release Flak Launcher. All techniques to destroy the Swarm require this weapon to be fitted.

### Ring Flakking

Rings are a swarm formation first used by the Medusa and very common with Medusa and Hydra swarms.
It is more difficult to flak because of the hollow area in the center, flak shots need to be aimed in a certain manner to hit the outer rim of the ring reliably.

## Painbeavering

A more advanced technique.

Involves chasing the swarm and flakking it while it's flying away from you (after flying over you.)

It is one of the few ways that slow ships (notably the ‘Vette, but also the ‘Conda and FGS) can effectively deal with the swarm.
But it can also be employed by faster ships to deal with the swarm quickly and effectively.

This technique avoids having to flak the Ring on higher tier interceptors as the swarm will temporarily enter a tighter form when employing this technique, no matter its current formation.

Named after CMDR Painbeaver.
