# Header text

In the current meta, the **Krait Mk.II is the most versatile ship**. With the ability to mount any weapon, plenty of optional internals, a massive powerplant, and good maneuverability, the Krait Mk.II is the **best all-around starter build**.

### Solo Krait Mk.II

#### **Solo Build**

The shieldless Krait is a tried and true powerhouse. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any AX weapon effectively. This build is designed specifically for solo fights, and is lacking in coutermeasures against caustic and shutdown fields (which can be avoided solo).

### AXCZ Krait Mk.II

#### **AZCX Build**

This build has a Thermal Vent Beam Laser instead of Flak, and brings a Shutdown Field Neutralizer and Caustic Sink Launcher to mitigate the added hazards found in AXCZs. The limpets can cargo rack can be safely removed if fighting at a planetary or station CZ.
