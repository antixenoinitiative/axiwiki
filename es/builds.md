# Construcciones Recomendadas
La Cacería de Thargoides requiere construcciones especializadas de naves, ya que los Thargoides tienen resistencias especiales y causan daños especiales que normalmente causarán problemas en cualquier construcción de combate estándar. Como tal, hemos elaborado la siguiente guía para ayudarlo a tomar las decisiones correctas que lo guiarán hacia la construcción de la nave más efectiva para cazar naves alienígenas. Estas construcciones de naves están diseñadas para brindarle un equilibrio de potencia de fuego y capacidad de supervivencia, al mismo tiempo que son lo suficientemente indulgentes como para cometer algunos errores.

> Consulte nuestra página de [Teoría de Construcción de Naves](/en/shipbuildtheory) para obtener una explicación más detallada detrás de las decisiones de equipamiento.

## Tipos de Construcción de Nave

En primer lugar, tenga en cuenta que hay dos tipos principales de Thargoides: **Exploradores Thargoides** e **Interceptores de Thargoides**. Dado que estos enemigos tienen mecanismos y capacidades muy diferentes, normalmente necesitaremos un tipo diferente de construcción para cada uno.

# Construcciones Contra interceptor

Thargoid Interceptors are very tough and powerful enemies that will require equally strong ships to be able to stand a chance in combat. Due to the incredibly high damage output of Thargoid Interceptors, there are only a handful of different styles and methods you can use effectively.

These are the most common types of builds used for Anti-Xeno Combat.

-   **Fast Shielded Builds** (Bi-Weave Hybrids) - Ships with good speed and small shields that regenerate quickly (Beginner)

-   **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage (Moderate)

-   **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically (Moderate/Advanced)


## Beginner Builds

These builds all utilize shields to provide a more familiar style of combat, while also being equipped for cold orbiting techniques. If you are looking to ease into AX combat, shielded builds are recommended because of their ease of use on Cyclops and Basilisk variant Interceptors. These ships fall under two categories: Bi-Weave Hybrids, which make use of Cold Orbiting techniques but provide shields as a backup, and Shield Tanks, which rely on massive raw shield MJ to keep them alive.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Krait Mk.II (Shielded)

#### **Krait Mk.II (Shielded)**

The most commonly recommended and best all-round AX ship for anyone interested in killing Thargoids, the Krait Mk.II has enough firepower to kill the tougher interceptors while also having enough shields and hull to be able to recover from a few mistakes. A very capable AX vessel, although the shielded version can only go so far.

Type: **Bi-Weave Hybrid**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Best starting ship for new pilots in AX.

Note: While this build uses Lo-Draw on the shields, Fast Charge experimental is also a great option that requires more pip management but faster recharge.

### Alliance Chieftain (Shielded)

#### **Alliance Chieftain (Shielded)**

The Alliance Chieftain, similar to the Krait Mk.II is a very capable AX Ship. The Chieftain has slightly lower overall firepower but is able to equip a Thermal Vent Beam laser allowing pilots to begin to learn cold orbiting techniques. Much more agile than the Krait Mk.II, this build is perfect for people looking to fly the meta shieldless Chieftain but still want the comfort of shields.

Type: **Bi-Weave Hybrid**
- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shield: ⭐⭐
- Armour:   ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Good upgrade path for confident pilots. More potential in the long run.

### Imperial Cutter (Shielded)

#### **Imperial Cutter (Shielded)**

If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage. If you intend to use the Cutter, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.

Type: **Shield Tank**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐
- Shield: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Different fighting style and generally very capable with weaker Interceptors. Becomes much harder for tougher variants.

## Intermediate Builds

These builds are targeted at more experienced commanders, either those who have flown the above ships against Thargoids before or have prior PVP combat experience. These ships are generally more capable than the beginner builds, and are better suited for all variants of Interceptors. These builds are cold orbiters, which make use of Cold Orbiting to evade most damage and repair limpets repair hull damage sustained.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)

#### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.

Type: **Cold**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Unarguably the best ship and build style for AX combat.

### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)

#### **Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)**

A shieldless version of the beginner Krait MK.II. The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output. The Krait's massive power plant also allows it to idle under 20% heat, which allows for cold approaches without a heatsink or thermal vent beam.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: A great upgrade from the shielded build.

### Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)

#### **Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)**

The Alliance Chieftain, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower but more stable alternative with slightly higher damage output. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: A great ship for those who find the Chieftain too responsive.

### Federal Corvette (Shieldless)

#### **Federal Corvette (Shieldless)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

### Federal Corvette (Shielded)

#### **Federal Corvette (Shielded)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. By utilizing prismatic or even bi-weave shields, the Corvette can slug it out with the toughest of targets. Type: **Shield Tank**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

# Scout Builds
Hunting scouts is a very efficient method to increase combat rank. This is because all scouts are considered dangerous or deadly targets and will give a lot of experience per kill. Due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Due to the unpredictable flight nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of Large Turreted Anti-Xeno Multi-Cannons as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. Keep in mind that there is a limit of 4 AX Weapons per vessel.

## Extra Modules Suggested
- **Decontamination Limpet Controller (and Cargo Racks)** - For when hit by caustic missiles.
- **Xeno Scanner (optional)** - Lets you see scout health %.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Scouts deal phasing damage which will damage you through shields, you will require both heavy Shields AND Hull.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Decent Shields
- Lots of AX Multi-Cannons
- Decontamination Limpets

And you’re good to go!

- Can fit all 4x AX Multi-Cannons in large hardpoints
- Has good angles for turreted Multi-Cannons
- Can be fitted with large shields and boosters for worry-free farming

- Can fit 3x AX Multi-Cannons in large hardpoints and 1x AX Multi-Cannon in a medium slot
- Alternatively can fit 2x AX Multi-Cannons in large hardpoints, and 2x Guardian Gauss Cannons in the medium hardpoints (allows for Gauss aim practice and becomes more effective once the user is proficient with Gauss)
- High mobility to keep targets in range or disengage.
- Mobility allows for use of Bi-Weave shields, disengaging for shield regen.
