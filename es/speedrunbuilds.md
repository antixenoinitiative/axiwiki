# Speedrun Builds

> These ship builds are not recommended for pilots new to Anti-Xeno Content, they require a solid understanding of Thargoid mechanics and abilities to be able to survive, let alone destroy an Interceptor. **USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** In the right hands, however, they can be more effective than the standard ones.

There are several differences between a general-purpose AX build and a speedrunner - they key difference being the focus of survivability and versatility in general builds, whereas speedrun builds can be highly specific to a particular variant and often forego self-repair capabilities, instead focusing on lasting just long enough to complete the kill.

- Since these fights are short and intense, repair limpets do not have the time to return the hull that is sacrificed to equip a controller and cargo rack, and AFMUs may not be necessary.
- Shields, while offering excellent protection from ramming damage, are useless if utilizing Silent Running - an extremely valuable tool in the speedrunner's arsenal.
- Shutdown Field Neutralizers can be useful as some techniques involve triggering the EMP/Caustics on purpose to accelerate the fight.
- Thermal vent beam lasers are less important as the builds can rely on Silent Running for short periods of time, and there is almost no kiting involved in these fights

### Krait Mk.II
One of the most versatile AX ships, and one of the best choices for speedruns. It can be extremely tanky while bringing maximum damage output with its 4 Gauss. Can also fit two or three Large Shard Cannons which can be used to great effectiveness against the weaker Interceptor Variants.

### Beluga Liner
A surprising option that offers incredible toughness, firepower, maneuverability and better speed than the Anaconda or Corvette, with more room for heatsinks than a medium ship.

**Size:** Large
