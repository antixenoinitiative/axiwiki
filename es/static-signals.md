# Static Thargoid Signal Sources
Across human space there are a handful of permanent Distress Calls and Megaships that can spawn Interceptors. These will typically have 1-2 Interceptors spawn upon arrival. Megaships also will sometimes have scouts instead.

Relogging (exit to menu and log in) will cause these locations to refresh with potentially different Thargoids.

A few notable locations:

- **HR 1185** - Permanent Distress Call (Very useful to find multi-goid fights or solo Hydras outside of the Witch Head Nebula) - Read about the HR 1185 Distress Call Spawns here.
- **Deciat** - A few damaged Megaships (Scenarios around these can spawn Interceptors)
- **Gree** - This systems contains 2 megaships that can be used to summon Thargoids. Currently this is the only system officially approved by AXI for hosting megaship events.
