# Equipements Recommandés
Anti-Xeno operations require specialised ship builds as Thargoids have special resistances and deal special damage types that will typically render a standard combat build useless. As such, we have put together the following guide to help you make the correct decisions to lead you towards building the most effective ship for hunting down Thargoid vessels. These ship builds are designed to maximize firepower and survivability, allowing any commander, regardless of skill level, to achieve victory.

## Types de Configurations

Due to the variety of Thargoid Vessels and locations in which they may be encountered, there are a variety of specialized build classes required for Anti-Xeno combat. As a rule of thumb, **a solo-capable build is always the best option.** Variantions on the solo builds below form the core of all other build classes, as more specialized technology is usually required for more hostile locations.

There are two common build types used for Anti-Xeno Combat:

-   **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage

-   **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically

In addition, there are many different AX activities, and the builds for them can be quite different:
- **Solo Builds** - One commander, one (or more) interceptors. These builds form the basis of all other builds, and you should always start here.
- **Anti-Xeno Conflict Zone (AXCZ) Builds** - These builds are solo builds with various modifications to make them better suited for fighting in groups. Group AX presents a few hazards which usually aren't seen in solo fights.
- **Scout Builds** - Like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Scouts put up little resistance to a few Enhanced AXMCs.

The abscence of Titans, their maelstroms and Spire sites have made these builds obsolete:
- **Maelstrom Builds** - Heavily specialized for combat in the most extreme locations - where caustic clouds are thick, staying undetected is paramount, and guardian tech is useless. These build have the same base hull configuration as Solo Builds, but share little else.

- **Spire Builds** - Even more like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Spire sites are very low intensity combat zones where Cyclops interceptors and Scouts occasionally spawn, and where Orthrus interceptors are found in large numbers.  Builds for Spire sites are designed for maximum shield damage to Orthrus.

# Solo Builds

These builds are designed for **solo combat**, meaning one commander engaged with one or more interceptors. They have different requirements than Wing AXCZ or Maelstrom builds, but they form the core of all other builds.

Thargoid Interceptors are **very tough and powerful enemies** that will require equally strong ships to be able to stand a chance in combat. Due to the incredibly high damage output of Thargoid Interceptors, there are only a handful of different styles and methods you can use effectively.


## Vaisseaux pour Débutants

When starting out, stick to the tried and true. The Chieftain and the Krait have been the best ships for AX combat for a long time. The Chieftain offers exceptional agility paired with an excellent set of hardpoints. The Krait trades agility for firepower and is able to run four medium AX weapons. The odd one out is the Imperial Cutter as a large shielded ship, offering an entirely different style of combat.

  ## Tabset {.tabset}

  ### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless) !\[alliance-chieftain.png\](/img/alliance-chieftain.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

  The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.

  Type: **Cold Orbiter**

  - Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Unarguably the best ship and build style for AX combat.

  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)**

  The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any guardian weapon effectively. This is also a great platform for mounting Enhanced AXMCs for commanders who do not yet have access to guardian tech.

  Type: **Cold Orbiter**

  - Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Great for modified shard cannons and plasma chargers.

  Engineering Note: When downsizing the powerplant for extra weight reduction, power limits will require more engineering to keep everything running. Check EDSY for minimum engineering based on your specific build.

  ### Imperial Cutter (Shielded)
  !\[imperial-cutter.png\](/img/imperial-cutter.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Imperial Cutter (Shielded)**

  If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage. If you intend to use the Cutter, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.

  Type: **Shield Tank**

  - Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Shield: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Different fighting style and generally very capable with weaker Interceptors. Becomes much harder for tougher variants.

  [EDSY Shielded Build](https://edsy.org/s/vKj663S) </details>


## Vaisseaux pour Niveau Intermédiaire

These builds are targeted at more experienced commanders, either those who have flown the above ships against Thargoids before or have prior PVP combat experience. These ships offer different flight characteristics, new hardpoint setups and generally some variety while requiring more experience to use effectively.

  ## Tabset {.tabset}

  ### Alliance Challenger (Shieldless) !\[alliance-challenger.png\](/img/alliance-challenger.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)**


  The Alliance Challenger, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower alternative with higher damage output against an interceptor’s shields. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build. Its three medium hardpoints with good convergence make it a better platform for running modified Shard Cannons or Plasma Chargers.

  Type: **Cold Orbiter**

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Boucliers:
  - Coque: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: A great ship for those who find the Chieftain too responsive, or want to use shards or chargers.

  [EDSY Shieldless Build](https://edsy.org/s/vsftAn4)



  ### Federal Corvette (Shieldless)
  !\[federal-corvette.png\](/img/federal-corvette.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Federal Corvette (Shieldless)**

  One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.

  Type: **Cold Orbiter**

  - Speed: ⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Boucliers:
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

  ### Federal Corvette (Shielded)
  !\[federal-corvette.png\](/img/federal-corvette.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Federal Corvette (Shielded)**

  One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. By utilizing prismatic or even bi-weave shields, the Corvette can slug it out with the toughest of targets. Type: **Shield Tank**

  - Speed: ⭐⭐
  - Maniabilité: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Shield:⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

## Advanced Builds
A collection of more advanced builds can be found on the Advanced Builds page.

View even more ship builds by visiting our [Ship Build Repository](/en/buildrepository), a large collection of ship builds built by experienced AXI pilots, along with full stats, ratings, and build links.

# Anti-Xeno Conflict Zone Builds
Because of the presence of variables outside one's control (other players) and with more Interceptors on the field at once, certain modules are recommended. Most Solo builds can be refitted slightly to incorporate these modules, to get a ship well-equipped for AXCZ's.

## Extra Modules Suggested
- **Shutdown Field Neutralizer** - Interceptors fire an unavoidable Shutdown Pulse upon entering the AXCZ, for which you'll need an SFN.
- **Decontamination Limpet Controller or Caustic Sink Launcher** - Caustic missiles are more common, and Scouts & Interceptors leave caustic clouds behind when they die. Either of these modules will get rid of the caustic status effect, but overheating is also a viable option to remove it.
- **No Gauss cannons** - Because of the low ammo capacity of Gauss, it is recommended to bring other weapons instead, or to be prepared to synthesize/rearm a lot.

# Scout Builds
Hunting scouts is an efficient method to increase combat rank. This is because all scouts are considered dangerous or deadly targets and will give a lot of experience per kill. Scout killers also hold a valuable role in Anti-Xeno Conflict Zones. Due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Due to the unpredictable flight nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of **Large Enhanced Anti-Xeno Multi-Cannons**, either Gimballed or Turreted, as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. While vessels used to be limited to four AX Weapons, Azimuth's stabilizers now allow ships to mount up to six, allowing for truly devasating scout killers.

## Extra Modules Suggested
- **Decontamination Limpet Controller (and Cargo Rack)** - For when hit by caustic missiles.
- **Enhanced Xeno Scanner** - Lets you see scout health and type, as well as allowing you to scan Interceptors for heart targeting.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need strong shields and hull to withstand their attacks.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Decent Shields
- As many AX Multi-Cannons as you can fit
- Decontamination Limpets

  ## tabset {.tabset}

  ### Vulture (Shielded) !\[vulture.png\](/img/vulture.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Vulture**

  - Very cheap at 25 million credits
  - 2x Large AX Multicannons, and a class 5 shield generator
  - Does not need engineering, although it is still recommended

  [**Unengineered Vulture Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vdAYRaG) [**Engineered Vulture Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vs1wd7p)


  ### Krait Mk.II (Shielded)
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  - Can fit 3x Large and 2x Medium AX Multi-Cannons.
  - Alternatively can swap 1 AXMC for a Thermal Vent Beam Laser.
  - High mobility to keep targets in range or disengage.
  - Good upgrade from a Vulture, allowing for powerful AXCZ support.

  [**Krait Mk.II Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vgZzbI2)


  ### Anaconda (Shielded)
  !\[anaconda.png\](/img/anaconda.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Anaconda**

  - Can fit all 4x Large and 2x Medium AX Multi-Cannons
  - Can be fitted with large shields and boosters for worry-free farming
  - Overkill in nearly all cases

  [**Anaconda Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vy3MVEQ)


  ### Type-10 Defender (Shielded)
  !\[type-10-defender.png\](/img/type-10-defender.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### Type-10 Defender

  - Outclassed by the Anaconda in pretty much every way
  - Some people just really like flying this ship, for some reason. So here it is.

  [**Type-10 Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vsBBqw3) </details>

# Best In Class - Krait Mk.II
In the current meta, the **Krait Mk.II is the most versatile ship**. With the ability to mount any weapon, plenty of optional internals, a massive powerplant, and good maneuverability, the Krait Mk.II is the **best all-around starter build**.

Do note that cold orbiting in the Krait requires more finesse than in the Chieftain. Due to its weaker lateral thrusters, you will need to boost at correct times, which can be difficult. Because of this reason, we often recommend new players to start out with the Chieftain, as it doesn't need this boost to keep orbiting.

  ### Solo Krait Mk.II !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Solo Build**

  The shieldless Krait is a tried and true powerhouse. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any AX weapon effectively. This build is designed specifically for solo fights, and is lacking in countermeasures against caustic and shutdown fields (which can be avoided solo).

  [Solo Krait Mk.II Build](https://edsy.org/s/vOD6Gi4)

  ### AXCZ Krait Mk.II !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right} #### **AXCZ Build**

  This build has a Thermal Vent Beam Laser instead of Flak, and brings a Shutdown Field Neutralizer and Caustic Sink Launcher to mitigate the added hazards found in AXCZs. The limpets and cargo rack can be safely removed if fighting at a planetary or station CZ with an active station.

  The "repairless" build below is specifically for active port defense where repairs are readily available. For space AXCZ, it is necessary to take your own repairs with you. The Modified Shard Cannons on the "repairless" build can be swapped for Modified Plasma Chargers, or perhaps a mix of 2x Modified Plasma Chargers and 2x Class 3 Enhanced Multi-Cannons.

  ### Maelstrom Krait Mk.II !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Maelstrom Diver Build**

  The Krait Mk.II is a tried and true favorite of maelstrom divers, as it offers substantial firepower and optional internals while still maintaining good maneuverability. The Maelstrom (or TitanKiller) Krait can be outfitted with a variety of weapon loadouts; the example given is the "fighter" configuration with Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons. For more detail on alternative options, visit the "Titan builds" section below.

  - AXMCs: 3 large, 1 medium
  - Speed: 385m/s, 530m/s boost
  - Hull: 3,050

  ### Low-Engineering Krait Mk.II
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Low-Engineering Build**

  While not recommended, this build gives a sense for what grade three engineering looks like. While grade five is always recommended, the Krait can still be a potent vessel even with minimal engineering.

# Retired Builds
The following builds are no longer relevant because of the abscence of living Titans and their Spire sites.

## Titan Builds
Titan Maelstroms contain an anti-guardian field and large caustic zones.  Specialized ships are required to be effective in these operating conditions, and Guardian internal modules will be destroyed; Guardian weapons (but not modules)  can, however, be engineered to avoid this. These are modifications of other meta ships, designed to either strike directly at the Titan itself, or to provide combat interdiciton to Thargoid Scouts or Interceptors in Titan space, with various specific modifications.

### Extra Modules Suggested
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Protects you from the caustic clouds and missiles present in Maelstrom combat.
- **Thargoid Pulse Neutralizers** - Required for passing into the center of a Maelstrom, these also act against Interceptor shutdown pulses.
- **Thermal Vent engineered Beam Lasers** - These enable cold running in combat, reducing the likelihood and accuracy of incoming fire.
- **Nanite Torpedo Launcher** - This torpedo launcher can damage the thermal vents on the dorsal side of the Titan, causing the Titan to expose its thermal core, which enables damage to the Titan itself.

  ### Krait Mk.II Bomber (Shieldless) - "Farseer"beginner build !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Krait Mk.II**

  DISCLAIMER – this build is recommended only as an entry-level stepping stone towards more effective builds.

  PREREQUISITES – Access to Felicity Farseer is required, and will enable you to engineer your Power Plant, Thrusters, Frame shift Drive and Sensors.  You will need to donate 1x meta alloy, a commodity which can be purchased from Fleet Carriers, for access to Felicity Farseer's engienering workshop.  Once access is acquired you will need to obtain the following engineering materials:

    7x Iron
    3x Hybrid Capacitors
    2x Heat Vanes
    3x Specialized Legacy Firmware
    1x Mechanical Equipment
    3x Vanadium
    5x Grid Resistors
    1x Chromium
    1x Mechanical Components

  If you wish to engineer your sensors for long range you will also need these further materials:

    3x Iron
    2x Hybrid capacitors
    1x Unexpected Emission Data

  USING THIS BUILD – You will need to run cold to avoid detection, by turning off the Frame Shift Drive, Repair Limpet Controller, Auto Field Maintenance Unit, one Heatsink Launcher, and the Cargo Hatch when not in use. Retreat to the asteroid belt near the Titan where enemy ships will not follow, before turning any of these back on for repairs.  You will also need to synthesize heatsinks to stay in titan space for any length of time, so it would be prudent to stock up on a lagre quantity of the following:

    Basic Conductors
    Heat Conduction Wiring

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 AX and 2s class 2 Missile Racks
  - 1x Guaridan Nanite Torpoedo Pylon
  - Speed: 346m/s, 476m/s boost
  - Hull: 1,376

  [TitanKiller "Farseer" Bomber Build](https://edsy.org/s/vUp8dG8)


  ### Krait Mk.II Bomber (Shieldless)
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  The Krait Mk.II is the workhorse of the Second Thargoid War, offering substantial firepower and optional internals, while still maintaining good maneuverability.

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 AX Missile Racks (Sirius AX Missile Racks are most effective, and are in the build but require a lot of materials to purchase; Enhanced AX Missile Racks are also effective)
  - 1x class 2 gimballed beam laser with Long Range and Thermal Vent
  - Speed: 322m/s, 544m/s boost
  - Hull: 3,358

  [TitanKiller Bomber Build](https://edsy.org/s/voSTwzN)


  ### Krait Mk.II Fighter (Shieldless)
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  A Fighter variant of the Titankiller Bomber Krait.

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 and 1x class 2 AX Multi-Cannons - Azimuth Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons are incredibly effective but generate significant heat, and are expensive to purchase; Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons, purchased from Rescue Megaships are a very acceptable alternative, and Guardian Shard Cannons with anti-Guardian field engineering are also a highly powerful alternative
  - 1x class 2 gimballed beam laser with Long Range and Thermal Vent
  - Speed: 323/s, 547m/s boost

  [TitanKiller Fighter Build](https://edsy.org/s/v8shXsd) </details>

## Spire Builds
Thargoid Spire sites are low-threat conflict zones where Orthrus-type interceptors come and go regularly.  Combat in Spire sites assists with the recapturing of systems from Titans.  When engaged, Orthrus will summon packs of Scouts, and occasionally a Cyclops, to defend them.  Combat bonds for Orthrus kills are especially high at 15 million credits.

As with all Thargoid ships, due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Orthrus have a particularly strong shield, and will fire both a shutdown field, and an anti-Guardian field, when engaged.  The shutdown field can be countered with a Shutdown Field Neutraliser.  The anti-Guardian field immediately starts eroding the guardian modules and weapons of its target, and cannot be countered.  This means when weapons are subjected to the anti-Guardian field, the CMDR is in a race against time to destroy the Orthrus before their weapons completely fail.

### Extra Modules Suggested
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Thargoids emit caustic clouds when they die, and taking caustic damage is inevitable.
- **Shutdown Field Neutraliser** - For countering the shutdown field emitted by Orthrus and Cyclops on engagement.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need a strong hull to withstand their attacks.

The general premise of Spire site builds is to create a ship which can survive in the caustic environment without resupplying.  this means:

- Decent Hull
- Strong damage to all Thargoid ship types
- Ability to remove caustic damage
- Self-repair functionality


### Spire Builds

  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless Missiles) !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right} #### **Krait Mk.II**

  The Krait can fit 3x Large and 2x Medium Enchanced AX Multi-Cannons (for Scouts) or Missile Racks (for Orthrus).  It can also be useful to swap 1x class 2 hardpoint for a Thermal Vent Beam Laser, for tagging Orthrus targets at range.  The Krait has high mobility to keep targets in range or disengage.  Overall, this build has strong all-round performance with great endurance, power and speed, and reasonable damage output.  The Missile variant is also particularly useful for clearing the Banshee skimmer-type missile launchers from Spire sites.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: A great entry-level ship for Spire AX.

  [**Shieldless Krait Missile Bomber Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vWmUQDT)


  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless Guardian)
  !\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  This build is very similar to the entry-level Missiles/Multi-cannons build but with enhanced engineering on the power plant to drive powerful Guardian weapons.  Modified Guardian plasma chargers and shard cannons are highly effective against Orthrus shields, albeit vulnerable to Anti-Guardian Fields.  Auto-Field Maintenance Units are therefore mandatory for these build types.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Agile and packs a punch, and strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Cyclops.

  [**Shieldless Krait Guardian Weapons Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vNSpM8O)



  ### Anaconda (Shielded)
  !\[anaconda.png\](/img/anaconda.png =250x){.align-right}

  #### **Anaconda (Shielded)**

  CMDR Mechan's famous "CytoPlasmaConda" build is designed to very effectively strip Orthrus shields.  Building this ship equires access to the Cytoscrambler lasers, a PowerPlay module from Archon Delaine.  Slow but extremely powerful, it is also vulnerable to  Anti-Guardian Fields so again, Auto-Field Maintenance Units are mandatory.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Not very agile but huge damage output; requires some finesse, especially for escaping interdictions.

  [**CytoPlasmaConda Build**](https://edsy.org/s/v0cjudk)


  ### Python Mk. II (Shielded)


  #### **Python Mk.II (Shielded)**

  This ship requires access to Class 2 and 3 Guardian Shard Cannons, as well as Guardian Zone Engineering from Ram Tah.  The Python Mk. II build is designed to strike at Orthrus interceptors in a solo instance, dodging incoming Banshee missiles and stacking a second Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser for when they can't be dodged, or attempting a strike run. Due to the internal module constraints of the Python Mk. II, this build also stacks Caustic sink Launchers to deal with Caustic damage and Shield Boosters, to shrug off incoming Scout fire.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: In the hands of a competent pilot this ship is highly capable of effectively demolishing Orthrus interceptors in a solo instance. The Shard Cannons can be used to clear Scouts but this is highly inefficient use of ammunition, so strike-and-run tactics work well here.
