# Equipements Recommandés
Anti-Xeno operations require specialised ship builds as Thargoids have special resistances and deal special damage types that will typically render a standard combat build useless. As such, we have put together the following guide to help you make the correct decisions to lead you towards building the most effective ship for hunting down Thargoid vessels. These ship builds are designed to maximize firepower and survivability, allowing any commander, regardless of skill level, to achieve victory.

## Types de Configurations

Due to the variety of Thargoid Vessels and locations in which they may be encountered, there are a variety of specialized build classes required for Anti-Xeno combat. As a rule of thumb, **a solo-capable build is always the best option.** Variantions on the solo builds below form the core of all other build classes, as more specialized technology is usually required for more hostile locations.

There are two common build types used for Anti-Xeno Combat:

-   **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage

-   **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically

In addition, there are many different AX activities, and the builds for them can be quite different:
- **Solo Builds** - One commander, one (or more) interceptors. These builds form the basis of all other builds, and you should always start here.
- **AXCZ Builds** - These builds are solo builds with various modifications to make them better suited for fighting in groups. Group AX presents a few hazards which usually aren't seen in solo fights.
- **Maelstrom Builds** - Heavily specialized for combat in the most extreme locations - where caustic clouds are thick, staying undetected is paramount, and guardian tech is useless. These build have the same base hull configuration as Solo Builds, but share little else.
- **Scout Builds** - Like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Scouts put up little resistance to a few Enhanced AXMCs.
- **Spire Builds** - Even more like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Spire sites are very low intensity combat zones where Cyclops interceptors and Scouts occasionally spawn, and where Orthrus interceptors are found in large numbers.  Builds for Spire sites are designed for maximums shield damage to Orthrus.

# Best In Class - Krait Mk.II
In the current meta, the **Krait Mk.II is the most versatile ship**. With the ability to mount any weapon, plenty of optional internals, a massive powerplant, and good maneuverability, the Krait Mk.II is the **best all-around starter build**.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Solo Krait Mk.II
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Solo Build**

The shieldless Krait is a tried and true powerhouse. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any AX weapon effectively. This build is designed specifically for solo fights, and is lacking in coutermeasures against caustic and shutdown fields (which can be avoided solo).

### AXCZ Krait Mk.II
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **AZCX Build**

This build has a Thermal Vent Beam Laser instead of Flak, and brings a Shutdown Field Neutralizer and Caustic Sink Launcher to mitigate the added hazards found in AXCZs. The limpets can cargo rack can be safely removed if fighting at a planetary or station CZ.

### Maelstrom Krait Mk.II
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Maelstrom Diver Build**

The Krait Mk.II is a tried and true favorite of maelstrom divers, as it offers substantial firepower and optional internals, while still maintaining good maneuverability.

- AXMCs: 3 large, 1 medium
- Speed: 385m/s, 530m/s boost
- Hull: 3,050

### Low-Engineering Krait Mk.II
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Low-Engineering Build**

While not recommended, this build gives a sense for what grade three engineering looks like. While grade five is always recommended, the Krait can still be a potent vessel even with minimal engineering.

# Solo Builds

These builds are designed for **solo combat**, meaning one commander engaged with one or more interceptors. They have different requirements than Wing AXCZ or Maelstrom builds, but they form the core of all other builds.

Thargoid Interceptors are **very tough and powerful enemies** that will require equally strong ships to be able to stand a chance in combat. Due to the incredibly high damage output of Thargoid Interceptors, there are only a handful of different styles and methods you can use effectively.


## Vaisseaux pour Débutants

When starting out, stick to the tried and true. The Chieftain and the Krait have been the best ships for AX combat for a long time. The Chieftain offers exceptional agility paired with an excellent set of hardpoints. The Krait trades agility for firepower and is able to run four medium AX weapons. The odd one out is the Imperial Cutter as a large shielded ship, offering an entirely different style of combat.

## Liste {.tabset}

### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)
!\[alliance-chieftain.png\](/img/alliance-chieftain.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Unarguably the best ship and build style for AX combat.

### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)**

The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output. The Krait's massive distributor and numerous hardpoints allow it to mount four of any guardian weapon effectively. This is also a great platform for mounting Enhanced AXMCs for commanders who do not yet have access to guardian tech.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Great for modified shard cannons and plasma chargers.

Engineering Note: When downsizing the powerplant for extra weight reduction, power limits will require more engineering to keep everything running. Check EDSY for minimum engineering based on your specific build.

### Imperial Cutter (Avec Boucliers)
!\[imperial-cutter.png\](/img/imperial-cutter.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Imperial Cutter (Shielded)**

If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage. If you intend to use the Cutter, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.

Type: **Shield Tank**

- Vitesse: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Maniabilité: ⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shield: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Different fighting style and generally very capable with weaker Interceptors. Becomes much harder for tougher variants.

## Vaisseaux pour Niveau Intermédiaire

These builds are targeted at more experienced commanders, either those who have flown the above ships against Thargoids before or have prior PVP combat experience. These ships offer different flight characteristics, new hardpoint setups and generally some variety while requiring more experience to use effectively.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)
!\[alliance-challenger.png\](/img/alliance-challenger.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)**


The Alliance Challenger, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower alternative with higher damage output against an interceptor’s shields. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build. Its three medium hardpoints with good convergence make it a better platform for running modified Shard Cannons or Plasma Chargers.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Boucliers:
- Coque: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: A great ship for those who find the Chieftain too responsive, or want to use shards or chargers.

### Federal Corvette (Shieldless)
!\[federal-corvette.png\](/img/federal-corvette.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Federal Corvette (Shieldless)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Maniabilité: ⭐⭐⭐
- Boucliers:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

### Federal Corvette (Shielded)
!\[federal-corvette.png\](/img/federal-corvette.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Federal Corvette (Shielded)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. By utilizing prismatic or even bi-weave shields, the Corvette can slug it out with the toughest of targets. Type: **Shield Tank**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

# Maelstrom Builds
Due to the anti-guardian fields and other unqiue threats of fighting in Maelstrom systems, specialized ships are required to be effective. These are modifications of other meta ships, with various specific modifications:
- **Enhanced AX Multicannons** - Safe from the anti-guardian field of a Maelstrom.
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Protects you from the caustic clouds and missiles present in Maelstrom combat.
- **Thargoid Pulse Neutraliers** - Required for passing into the center of a Maelstrom, these also act against Interceptor shutdown pulses.
- **Thermal Vent Beam Lasers** - These entierly counteract the heat generated by AXMCs, allowing for constant cold running in combat.

It should be noted that these builds not only allow for but recommend constant use of their thermal vent beam lasers, which completely offsets the heat generated by the AXMCs.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)
!\[krait-mk-ii.png\](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Krait Mk.II**

The Krait Mk.II is a tried and true favorite of maelstrom divers, as it offers substantial firepower and optional internals, while still maintaining good maneuverability.

- AXMCs: 3 large, 1 medium
- Speed: 385m/s, 530m/s boost
- Hull: 3,050

### Anaconda (Shieldless)
!\[anaconda.png\](/img/anaconda.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Anaconda**
Offering unrivaled firepower and staying power, the Anaconda is only lacking in maneuverability.

- AXMCs: 4 large, 2 medium
- Speed: 285m/s, 380m/s boost
- Hull: 5,250

[Maelstrom Anaconda Build](https://edsy.org/s/vcgYAjt)

### Mamba (Shieldless)
!\[mamba.png\](/img/mamba.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Mamba**
While usually an off-meta ship, the Mamba's capability to mount 3 large AXMCs, maintain good speed, and effortlessly stay at around 20% heat make it uniquely viable in Malestrom combat. It is heavily lacking in hull, and should only be considered by experienced commanders.

- AXMCs: 3 large
- Speed: 491m/s, 602m/s boost
- Hull: 1,775

# Scout Builds
Hunting scouts is an efficient method to increase combat rank. This is because all scouts are considered dangerous or deadly targets and will give a lot of experience per kill. Scout killers also hold a valuable role in Anti-Xeno Conflict Zones. Due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Due to the unpredictable flight nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of **Large Enhanced Anti-Xeno Multi-Cannons**, either Gimballed or Turreted, as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. While vessels used to be limited to four AX Weapons, Azimuth's stabilizers now allow ships to mount up to six, allowing for truly devasating scout killers.

## Extra Modules Suggested
- **Decontamination Limpet Controller (and Cargo Rack)** - For when hit by caustic missiles.
- **Enhanced Xeno Scanner** - Lets you see scout health and type, as well as allowing you to scan Interceptors for heart targeting.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need strong shields and hull to withstand their attacks.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Decent Shields
- As many AX Multi-Cannons as you can fit
- Decontamination Limpets

And you’re good to go!

### Vulture (Shielded)
!\[vulture.png\](/img/vulture.png =250x){.align-right}
#### **Vulture**

- Very cheap at 25 million credits
- 2x Large AX Multicannons, and a class 5 shield generator
- Does not need engineering, although it is still recommended

[**Unengineered Vulture Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vdAYRaG) [**Engineered Vulture Build**](https://edsy.org/s/vs1wd7p)

### Type-10 Defender (Shielded)
!\[type-10-defender.png\](/img/type-10-defender.png =250x){.align-right}
#### Type-10 Defender

- Outclassed by the Anaconda in pretty much every way
- Some people just really like flying this ship, for some reason. So here it is.
