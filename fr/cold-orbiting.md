# Cold Orbiting

Cold orbiting is a technique used mainly with **small** and **medium** ships to avoid damage from the Interceptor’s main cannon. Cold Orbiting relies upon using heatsinks to stay cold while moving in an orbiting motion around the interceptor, a Thargoid cannot hit you with their main gun when:

1. You are moving perpendicular to the Thargoid’s facing direction with sufficient speed.
2. Your ship’s effective heat is below 20% (Heatsinks, Thermal Vent Beam or Silent Running)

Cold orbiting can be used in different phases of the fight, While waiting for a shield to drop, cold orbiting can be maintained with a thermal vent Beam. During a Gauss attack run you will require constant heatsinks to avoid going above 20% heat.

To effectively cold orbit, you will need to be able to comfortably fly in **Flight Assist Off** mode.

This technique is mainly for medium or small ships, large ships will struggle to maintain the necessary speed and agility to orbit. However, it is possible to enter a partial orbit in some large ships (such as the Corvette), allowing you to avoid at least some of the damage.

## Managing Heat

In order to keep control of your heat here are a few tips:

- Always use heatsinks when firing Gauss. This will prevent your heat from going above 20% (deploy a heatsink when your previous one ejects, at minimum)

- Split your Gauss firegroups in half, firing 2x Gauss cannons at a time. This will prevent the heat from temporarily spiking above 20% allowing the goid to hit you. (if done fast enough this can be done without losing appreciable DPS)

## Tutorial videos

Some things are easiest explained with some visual demonstrations tied to them, here is a collection of Tutorials that AX Commanders have created over the years. You can find even more on YouTube!
