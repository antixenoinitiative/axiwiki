# Introduction

Tout d'abord, le speedrun n'est pas fait pour les débutants en combat Anti-Xeno.

We generally recommend CMDRs attain at least the Serpent's Nemesis rank (Medusa solo) before they focus on learning the advanced techniques involved in speedrunning.

# Rangs en speedrun

Il y a deux rangs associés au speedrun (N.d.T: encore une fois sur le serveur discord de l'AXI) : Myrmidon et Caduceus' Glint

## Myrmidon - "Silver" color

Myrmidon is the "Vanguard" equivalent rank for speedrunning kills. Whereas Vanguard requires you to do a complex or off-meta kill, but gives you no time limit, Myrmidon allows you to use a meta ship, but gives you a strict time limit.

Time limits, for a solo Medusa kill,are as follows:
- 24’00’’000’’’ - Small Ship
- 12’00’’000’’’ - Medium Ship
- 6’00’’000’’’ - Large Ship

Applications are to be submitted using the form below: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5BGMqarMg3eQnDsvu0PcPq8NaLWjH6lKlbjSHO_RaTrTSnA/viewform

## Cadeceus' Glint - "Gold" color

Caduceus' glint, or glint for short, is the "Ace" equivalent for speedrunning kills. It is one of only two "competitive" ranks - as in, you can lose this rank.

Only up to 9 glint CMDRs can exist at any one point, and typically (because a CMDR can hold a record in more than one category) there will be fewer than 9.

Glint is awarded for the fastest small/medium/large ship kill on Basilisk, Medusa, and Hydra. Cyclops do NOT award a Glint rank.

Feeling skilled? Try to see if you can collect them all nine golden rings ...

# Speedrunning Theory

Speedrunning is about killing a Thargoid in the shortest amount possible, without resorting to bugs or unintended mechanics (e.g., "gibbing").

In order to get started, the first thing you'll want to understand is the detailed behavior of Goid AI upon heart distruction. Understanding this is critical to avoid triggering "panic shields":
