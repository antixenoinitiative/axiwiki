# Trouver des Thargoids
Les Thargoids savent se faire discrets mais il existe des astuces et des zones d'activité à connaître qui peuvent vous aider à trouver ce que vous cherchez. Le moyen le plus fiable est de chercher des Thargoids dans les **Sources de Signal Non Humaines (NHSS)** dans les régions des Pléiades, de Coalsack ou de Witch Head Nebula. They are not reliable spawns inside of the war systems, you can also find Thargoids at a few static locations across human space.

## Emplacements Thargoids

Thargoids can be found in various locations, such as:
- [Non-Human Signal Sources](/en/nhss) (Pleaides, Witch Head and Coalsack Nebulae)
- [Hyperdictions](/en/hyperdictions) (Pleaides, Witch Head and Coalsack Nebulae)
- [Static Signal Sources](/en/static-signals) (Bubble, Pleaides, Witch Head and Coalsack Nebulae)
- [Thargoid Structures](https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-structure/?highlight=structure) (Pleaides, Witch Head and Coalsack Nebulae)
- **Megaships** (Bubble, Pleiades Nebula)
- [AX Conflict Zones](/en/finding-thargoids#ax-conflict-zones-axczs)

## Current Active Regions (and suggested systems)
- #### **Pleiades Nebula**
  - *Has stations if you don't have a Fleet Carrier and are close to the Bubble, and Sterope II is a recommended Hydra hunting ground*
  - ~175ly around **Merope**
  - **Pleiades Sector MI-S B4-0**: *Historically known as The Zoo, this was known for being the only system to spawn solo, no-scout Hydras in both “guaranteed” (triple icon / debris field) and non-guaranteed (single icon / green cloud) instances; it is still a recommended Hydra hunting ground but not the only place that Hydras can be found.*
    - We recommend: **Asterope**, **Merope**, **Sterope II**
- #### **Coalsack Nebula**
  - *No station in-system or nearby, but contains high spawn density of higher-threat NHSSes if you have a Fleet Carrier to operate out of, and also has material traders within approximately ~30 LY's*
  - ~60ly around **Musca Dark Region PJ-P B6-1**
  - We recommend: **Musca Dark Region HM-V c2-17**
- #### **California Nebula**
    - ~100ly around **HIP 18390**
  - Only known locations of of AX Conflict Zones (see [below](/en/finding-thargoids#ax-conflict-zones-axczs))
- #### **Witch Head Nebula**
    - ~75ly around **Witch Head Sector IR-W C1-9**

## AX Conflict Zones (AXCZs)

The only currently-known (as of February 2025) active AX Conflicts Zones are in the California Nebula.

California Sectors:
- BA-A e6 - 1x High, 1x Medium AXCZ near body 4, both functional
    - Medium CZ is 450km altitude within orbital cruise.
- HR-W d1-28 - 2x High, 1x Medium AXCZ near body 3 (~260Ls from star)
    - Medium CZ and one high CZ were on same side of planet at time of recon - Those two worked (scenario popup & thargs/AX pilots spawn)
  - The Second high CZ @ ~1.38Mm altitude on Opposite side was nonfunctional, no scenario, no spawns.
- JH-V c2-12 - 1x Medium AXCZ near body 6 (~45Ls), functional.

**We recommend the BA-A e6 High CZ or the JH-V c2-12 Medium CZ.**

## Carte des activités
**Note:** This map is from before the Coalsack CG and Salvation CG which caused Coalsack NHSS to appear and the Pleiades region to expand, respectively.
