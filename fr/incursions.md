# Thargoid Infestations
During times of active Thargoid behaviour, on a weekly basis a number of systems will become “Infested” each week and enter the **Infestation** state. This is first noted by the presence of [Non-Human Signal Sources](/en/nhss) containing various Scout and Interceptor variants. An Infestation indicates an incoming invasion in the same system, unless a large quantity of Thargoid vessels are destroyed in the system.

If an Insufficient number of Thargoid vessels are destroyed, the system will enter the Incursion state at the next weekly tick.

The Eagle Eye system will identify a new wave of infested systems each week. (Note: Eagle Eye and the Infestation cycle has been defunct since early 3306.)

# Thargoid Incursions
Should a system enter the Incursion state it will become under full Thargoid Assault. Once underway the system’s allegiance will change to “Thargoid” and multiple cumulative negative effects can be observed as the incursion persists.

- One undamaged **Starport** will become damaged in the system per week, until the Incursion is cleared.
- All **Bulk Cruiser Megaships** will become damaged at the start of the incursion.
- [Anti-Xeno Conflict Zones](/en/conflict-zones) will appear in the system.
- **Non-Human Signal Sources** will appear, if they were not already present.

Ships may be hyperdicted while jumping into a system under Incursion, regardless of marked status.

The **GalNet Thargoid Activity report** will provide an up-to-date report on the remaining presence of Thargoids within an Incursion system. As more Thargoid vessels are destroyed, the presence level will decrease until the incursion is cleared completely.

> Our Thargoid activity monitor [Thargoid.watch](https://www.thargoid.watch/) has gone live. You can find about the systems in Incursion and the regions Thargoids have inhabited.{.is-info}


Presence Levels are:

- Massive Thargoid Presence: **0-25% Cleared**
- Significant Thargoid Presence: **25-50% Cleared**
- Moderate Thargoid Presence: **50-75% Cleared**
- Marginal Thargoid Presence: **75-100% Cleared**
- No Thargoid Presence: **100% Cleared**

Once a system has been cleared, damaged starports will enter the **Repairing** state at the next weekly tick.

Damaged starports may enter the repairing state before the Incursion is cleared and they will destroyed again at the next tick if the Incursion persists.
