# Known Bugs

## Top Issues
These are the bugs which we request you vote for/confirm first, as they are the most important. After the fixing of the heart bug and a couple other AX bugs, this page is under redesign to collect information on current and past AX bugs and create a new list of priority issues.
### Encounterable in Solo
- Teleporting Swarm Missiles
- Lack of relative mouse and SFN keybinds
- Thargoids become frozen when shot while waking out
- GMRPs do not offer their stated lightning protection and cannot be disabled
- Bugged/missing megaship gameplay (inconsistent Thargoids spawns, bugged NPCs, bugged hatchbreaker salvage)

### Wing Bugs
- AXCZ desync and instability
- The vast variety of desync issues (undead goids, duplicate swarms, invisible swarms/interceptors/scouts, rubberbanding thargoids)
