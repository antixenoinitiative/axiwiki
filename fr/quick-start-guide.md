## A Short Quick-Start Guide to Anti-Xeno Protocol

If you are new to anti-xeno combat or operations, then the first priority should be to learn to identify the enemy. Head to [Thargoids](/en/thargoids) wiki page and pay attention to the "Thargoid Encounters" section. Come back here when ready for the next steps; setup and maneuvering.
> "This is a game for which almost all of its content is centered around 'Player controls a ship to...' How you setup your control scheme and utilize it is almost the entirety of the game. It's important, and you are responsible for the control scheme you are fighting against. Good luck!" - *From CMDR Toscany* {.is-info}

Visit [Reccommended Controls](/en/recommended-controls) to get started with a control scheme that prioritizes precision aim. Your maneuvering should facilitate Time on Target (ToT) and your fine yaw and pitch controls become your bread and butter for bringing home the kills. Next up is maneuvering and then targeting.

Thargoids that have engaged in combat are merciless. Survival is dependent on the pilot's ability to maneuver out of the way of incoming fire. Regardless of the pilot's build strategy, an understanding and practice of [Cold Orbiting](/en/cold-orbiting) will assist to ensure the survival of the pilot during any Thargoid encounter.

Once you know how to survive in the event of a Thargoid encounter, you gain options for going on the offensive. If things start to go sour in an encounter, you can and should disengage, seek repair, and try again. Going on the offensive with your shielded or shieldless strategy, visit [Advanced Combat Guide](/en/advanced-combat-guide) to get an introduction to a successful offensive strategy to combat with Thargoids.

What comes next is up to you!
