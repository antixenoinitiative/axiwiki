# Éclaireurs
!\[scouts.jpg\](/img/scouts.jpg =450x){.align-right}Les éclaireurs sont un type de vaisseau Thargoid plus petit et peuvent se trouver dans tous les types de Sources de Signal Non Humaines. Les éclaireurs sont immédiatement hostiles et en groupe peuvent causer des dommages importants à un pilote non préparé. Les éclaireurs, contrairement aux intercepteurs, ont 77% de résistance aux armes humaines, au lieu de 99%. Cette résistance aux dégâts réduite permet de tuer les éclaireurs avec les systèmes d'armes humaines, Cependant, les systèmes d'armes spécialisés AX sont bien plus efficaces que leurs homologues humains.

# Variants

Thargoid scouts come in multiple variants, each with their own special abilities.

## Marauder
Marauders are the basic variant of scout and the most common, They have a simple attack using a Basic Pulse Weapon and can also fire a simple Caustic missile.

## Regenerator
Regenerator variants are the same as the Marauder but have a special Regeneration pulse ability. The Regenerator may use this ability and apply a regeneration buff to all nearby scouts, rapidly regenerating their health. Regenerators will make an audible sound before using the attack and emit a green pulse. Regenerator variants will appear with a green coloration.

## Beserker
Similar to Regenerator, Beserker variants are marauders with a special ability. Beserkers can emit a red energy pulse that will buff the damage of all nearby scouts and trigger all nearby non-beserker scouts to fire a caustic missile. Beserkers have an Orange/red appearance.

## Inciter
Inciters are the same as a marauders with a special ability. When used the scout will emit an energy pulse to all nearby scouts, buffing their speed and maneuverability temporarily. Inciters have a pink/red appearance.

# Traits
- Scouts are ALWAYS hostile.
- Scouts have 77% resistance to conventional human weapons.
- Scouts are immune to missiles and torpedoes (they bounce off).
- Scouts occasionally shoot caustic missiles.
- The pulse of the special Scouts is instance-wide, which means it can affect very distant targets.

# Hunting Scouts

Hunting scouts is a very efficient method to increase combat rank. Due to the 77% resistance to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against scouts. Due to the unpredictable nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of Large Turreted Anti-Xeno Multicannons as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. Keep in mind that there is a limit of 4 Weapons per vessel.
