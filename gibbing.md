# Gibbing (Insta-gib)

Gibbing (Instagibbing) is the term referring to the use of overwhelming firepower to destroy a Thargoid Interceptor before its defenses can react. By attacking a Thargoid with sufficient firepower it is possible to reduce the Interceptorâ€™s hull to 0 faster than the health regeneration can heal. Typically this requires a large number of Pilots to all attack the Interceptor simultaneously.

It is also possible to Gib a Cyclops with a single CMDR, however this only works with **4x Large Shard Cannons** and **Premium Ammo.**
