<h1>Unlocking Guardian Weapons and Modules</h1>
<p>In order to collect Guardian Modules and Weapons, players will need to visit the guardian sites and collect a variety of materials. These include: Blueprints (specific to the module type), Components and Data. To collect these you will need a ship with an SRV and a decent jump range (Guardian sites are a bit out of the way).</p>
<p><strong>We also recommend you bring a spare SRV and a Point Defence module on your ship. Point Defence will shoot down the Guardian Sentinel missiles, making this much easier.</strong></p>
<p>Different Guardian sites will give different blueprints (Module, Weapon, Fighter). To gather the blueprints you will need to complete a small mini-game which involves shooting power orbs on a collection of pylons within a small time window. Once complete you will need to grab a Guardian Ancient Relic and drop it on the podium where you begin the mini-game. From here a large orb will spawn, you can scan it with a Data Link Scanner which will provide you with a blueprint. If you need multiple blueprints, you can then drive away from the site, log out of the game and back in, and start again.</p>
<p>While clearing out a site you will encounter Guardian Sentinels. These will shoot at you with projectiles and fire seeker missiles into the air. Simply take your time and kill these off one-by-one and you will have little issue clearing out a guardian site.</p>
<p>Here are some guardian sites you can use to get your modules and weapons:</p>
