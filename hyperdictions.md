# Hyperdictions

Hyperdictions are another less direct means to find Thargoids…. for Thargoids to find YOU. Hyperdictions occur when jumping from systems to system in Thargoid activity areas.

When a Hyperdiction occurs you will be ripped out of Hyperspace and left floating somewhere in-between the star systems you were jumping from (you will actually still be in the origin system). One of the hyperdicting thargoids will perform an EMP attack, which will shut down your ship if you are not protected (see: Modules). Similar to any other encounter, If the Scans you while carrying Thargoid or Guardian technology (cargo), it will become hostile if you do not drop the items.

If you have a Shutdown Field Neutralizer, it is possible to avoid the shutdown and proceed to engage the Interceptors.

> Hyperdictions can have more than 1 interceptor, up to 4 in total.

Based on combined research from Canonn and AXI we have found that collecting a sensor and jumping at least once with the sensor activates a hidden permanent ‘**marked**’ effect that applies a 20% Hyperdiction chance in the Pleiades and Witch Head Region.

To gather this data we performed the following test several times over on different accounts:

1. Jump 100 times between two systems in Pleiades (Result: Zero Hyperdictions)
1. Collect a Thargoid Sensor (Also tested Probes and the Proximity Scan from the sensor)
1. Jump 100 times between the same two systems in the Pleiades (Results: ~20 Hyperdictions)
1. To further confirm the Hyperdiction rate, CMDR Maligno has done over ~500 Jumps around these regions and found a very constant rate of ~20% per jump (once ‘marked’)

## How to get Hyperdictions
Thargoid Hyperdictions currently only occur when jumping to/from systems within two different regions of space.

- The Pleiades Bubble (all systems within 100-200Ly of Merope, due to hyperdiction bubble around it expanding and shrinking thanks to currently unknown reasons)

- The Witch Head Bubble (all systems within 75Ly of Witch Head Sector IR-W C1-9)
- The Coalsack Bubble (all systems within 60Ly of Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1)
- The California Bubble (all systems within 60Ly of California Sector BA-A e6)

These Hyperdictions will not occur for most pilots unless you activate a hidden "**marked**" effect that is applied by collecting rare Thargoid Commodities. Once you have been "**marked**" it is permanant and there is no known way to remove this.

Based on extensive research from the Anti-Xeno Initiative and Canonn Interstellar Research Group, we have found a distinctive correlation between certain types of Thargoid Commodities causing players to get hyperdicted. The current best understanding is the following:

Collecting a Thargoid Sensor applies a permanent "**marked**" affect on your player that will cause frequent Hyperdictions in the Pleiades and Witch Head Nebula. This affect is permanent once collecting a sensor and will continue to apply without the item in your cargo.

> Holding the sensor does not directly increase the chances, it only unlocks the 20% chance rate.

The only exception to this is the Thargoid Incursions and Thargoid Infestation system state, which have an independant hyperdiction chance which can cause hyperdictions without any previous interaction with Thargoid Sensors. This also includes systems with a "**hidden**" incursion state and some other unique systems for lore reasons, such as **HIP 22460**.

Thargoid sensors can be easily found at Crashed Thargoid Interceptor sites

## Hyperdiction Statistical Analysis
*By CMDR Maligno - Canonn Research*

When jumping between Celaeno and Asterope it was found that the Hyperdiction rate is 20.7%. When carrying 16 units of Meta-Alloys, the Hyperdiction rate was measured to be 21.6%, which is statistically the same as the baseline scenario. We can confidently conclude that the Hyperdiction rate in the core Pleiades systems is around 20% and is unaffected by carrying Meta-Alloys. [Update: additionally, hundreds of jumps were later carried out with 64 units of meta-alloys, which did not have an effect on the hyperdiction rate either]

We now turn to the composition of Hyperdiction scenarios, that is, what sort of Interceptors are present to greet a pilot that has been Hyperdicted.  The table below shows the combinations of Interceptors that were observed in this study, sorted by Interceptor lethality.  A total of 13 unique combinations were observed.  [Update: the results below are the result of further documentation of another several hundred hyperdiction instances]

As expected, Hyperdiction containing only one or two Cyclopes are the most common, whereas those containing Hydras are far more rare. Of the 539 documented Hyperdictions, only 31 contained at least one Hydra, with 8 cases containing an additional 3 Basilisks and 7 cases containing an additional pair of Medusae. Currently the statistics in this study are sufficiently high that we can state with confidence that a single, unaccompanied Hydra is more common than one accompanied by other Interceptors. Judging from the data, it appears that 50% of the Hydra instances don’t have additional Interceptors, 25% have 3 Basilisks and another 25% have Medusae. The statistics are still too limited to judge if a Hydra accompanied by 2 Medusae is the rarer of the three possibilities. It is interesting to note that cases that have a Medusa as the ranking Interceptor have an analogous set of (less lethal) cohorts: one case with 3 Cyclopes and another with 2 Basilisks.

No instances with two Hydras or two (unaccompanied) Medusae were ever observed. It’s entirely possible that those combinations exist but are simply exceedingly rare and have therefore not been observed yet.

## Hyperdiction Combat Guide

CMDR Katie Byrne has put together a comprehensive guide on Hyperdictions.  Her advice is highly encouraged for those who want to test their skills against many Thargoid Interceptors.
