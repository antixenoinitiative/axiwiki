# Guida al combattimento avanzato contro i thargoid
Lo scopo di questo metodo è quello di introdurre comandanti nuovi o veterani a un modo particolare di combattere e costruire navi contro tutte e 4 le varianti di thargoid. Il costo iniziale e' pensato per essere il piu' basso possible per consentire a chiunque di poter combattere qualsiasi variante di thargoid. In più, le diverse tattiche e manovre si applicano a tutte e 4 le varianti, con una sola manovra in piu' che serve per i basilisk.

Affinché questo metodo sia efficace, un comandante deve avere una comprensione di base di come volare senza flight assist. Usare il flight assist andra' a interferire con le manovre che fanno parte di questo metodo, e pertanto e' molto difficile applicarlo con flight assist on.

Questo metodo è basato su un loop continuo - essenzialmente si sta ripetendo la stessa tattica per tutti i cuori (aparte per l'inizio) permettendo a qualsiasi comandante di affinare le loro capacità nei movimenti specifici.

Questo metodo, inoltre, permette di concentrarsi sul pip management, visto che le navi saranno tutte senza scudi, permettendo una maggiore liberta' in termini di power management.

# Come equipaggiare la nave
Questo metodo usa la Chieftain come la propria nave principale. Si puo' usare anche la Challenger come sostituta, con leggere modifiche. (guida per come costruire una Challenger WIP) Navi come la Krait mk2, Krait phantom o FAS possono anche essere usate, ma per via del costo iniziale basso, la manovrabilita' e l'armamento della Chieftain, quest'ultima sara' quella su cui ci baseremo per questo metodo.

# Principi di configurazione ed ingegneria della nave
- Con la configurazione e gli ingegneri elencati, questa e' la base necessaria per essere in grado di usare la nave al massimo delle sue capacita'. Se utilizzerete tutti gli ingegneri utilizzerete al massimo le capacita' della Chieftain, che vi permettera' di combattere tutte le varianti in maniera efficiente.
- La velocita' della chieftain, se ingegnerizzata come consigliato sopra, superera' i 500 m/s, che sara' piu' del necessario a combattere qualsiasi variante. I Basilisk richiederanno una manovra in piu', per via della loro velocita' (vedi Misure necessarie per Basilisk).

- Lo scopo di utilizzare un repair limpet controller invece che uno scudo e' quello di permettere la riparazione della nave in caso di errori. Inoltre lo swarm fa' piu' (phasing damage) alle navi che hanno uno scudo rispetto a quelle senza, fornendo un vantaggio contro lo swarm. Inoltre, fornisce liberta' nel power management. Potrebbe essere necessario sintetizzare dei limpets in base al danno ricevuto, specialmente contro le varianti piu' difficili.

- Lo scopo dei 3 heatsinks (con Ammo capacity)

- Inexperienced commanders will be granted a big buffer in heat sinks to allow them to have plenty of heat sinks on hand if mistakes are made allowing this doctrine to be forgiving.

- The need for heat sink synthesis will be on a case by case basis dependent on Interceptor or experience of the commander.

- The Guardian Gauss Cannons when set into their fire groups should be split into two fire groups (1 medium to 1 Small) to maximize the heat efficiency of the ship when firing in alternating fire keeping the chieftain below 20% heat with a heat sink engaged.

- The long range thermal vent beam laser is utilized primarily after a heart is destroyed to put the Interceptor into a “Sleep Mode” without the use of heat sinks.

- Heat sinks may be needed if your heat is above 15% after a heart is destroyed. Sleep mode further explained in section VIII.

# Initial/First Heart Engagement and Subsequent Heart Combat Cycle
- Upon engaging a Thargoid Interceptor of any variant in a non-human signal source (NHSS) the initial engagement should occur after the Interceptor has finished his scan of you. The purpose of allowing the Interceptor to finish his scan of you will allow you to get a scan of the Interceptor if you have a xeno scanner fitted.
-
- Disengage your flight assist and engage with your beam laser. [Pips at: 0-4-2]
-
- Once the Interceptor is aggressed he will begin launching his swarm. Begin your boost past the Interceptor and gain the recommended distance of 4-6km. [Pips at: 0-4-2]
-
- Once at distance 180 turn while continuing your moment to engage the Thargon swarm. (If swarm management is needed see section V Swarm Management) [Pips at: 0-4-2]
-
- Once the swarm is destroyed you may begin your engagement of the Interceptor (preferably at 5km distance) with your thermal vent beam. This will drop your ship temperature to below 20% to allow you to begin your cold orbit around the Interceptor. [Pips at: 0-2-4]
-
- Begin your cold orbit attack run by applying down vertical thrust and forward until you achieve an orbit speed of about 180 m/s and maintain an orbit distance of between 900m-1.5km. **NOTE: Applying your thermal vent beam will allow you to set your orbit while avoiding damage from the Interceptor.**
-
- Once your orbit envelope is established switch to your gauss cannon fire group, engage a heat sink and begin your alternating fire of your gauss cannons. (Alternating fire should be achieved by activating the charge up of your second group once your first group of cannons fires its rounds.)
-
- Continue engaging heat sinks as needed once you hear “Heat Sink Deployed” from your COVAS until the heart has been exerted and destroyed.
-
- Each Interceptor variant also has an approximate attack run window and will allow you to stabilize your orbit. Once outside of its attack run window the Interceptor will change direction and reset for its own attack run forcing you to have to adjust your orbit accordingly. Use of your thermal vent beam during this time may be recommended if you drift outside of your orbit envelope.
-
- Cyclops ≈30 Seconds -Basilisk & Medusa ≈26 Seconds -Hydra ≈20 Seconds
-
- Once the first heart is destroyed immediately switch back to your beam laser and begin cooling your ship while also attempting to gain a minimum distance of 3km (engaging reverse thrust) from the Interceptor. This is the time to set a pip into Systems to recharge systems capacitor from your use of heat sinks. [Pips at: 1-4-1]
-
- The first heart is when the Interceptor is the most aggressive with its lightning ability with which it will aggressively chase you down. To avoid the ability, continue applying your beam laser to the Interceptor and once it reaches a distance of 1.5km apply downward thrust and forward thrust while engaging your boost while attempting to keep your beam laser on target and keep more than 800m away from the Interceptor. (For subsequent hearts the Interceptor is not as aggressive and you can maintain your distance from it by adjusting your reverse and forward thrust.)
-
- This maneuver will allow you to do a half orbit around the Interceptor forcing it to change its momentum (and all Interceptors are slow at changing direction) and keeping you under the 15% heat threshold keeping the Interceptor in sleep mode (Section VII Thargoid Interceptor Sleep Mode)
-
- Begin reverse thrust away from the Interceptor while still applying your beam laser on target. [Pips at: 0-4-2]
-
- Once the Interceptor begins launching its swarm you will want to maintain a distance of about 3.5km-6km until it launches its swarm fully and begin a 180 maneuver away from the Interceptor and begin boosting away. Use this time now to begin any repairs or synthesis if needed.
-
- Begin the initial swarm engagement stated above.
-
- This time the Interceptor will have a shield up (Shields goes up after the first heart is destroyed) and it will continue to decay over time.
-
- To maximize the time you have for heart destruction you can decrease the shield uptime by applying your beam laser to the Interceptor degrading its shields faster.
-
- Once the shields are down begin the cold orbit cycle listed above as part of the combat loop for all the subsequent hearts. (Using Gauss cannons against the shields is a waste of ammo especially when using precious premium synthesis)
-
- Begin your next combat loop with pips set at 0-2-4
-
- Another similar tactic to the cold boost would be to engage silent running and perform your boost maneuver 180 degrees past the Basilisk. (The options taken will be dependent upon the commander.) The purpose of this maneuver is to allow the commander to save a heat sink and achieve the same outcome while taking advantage of the shieldless build.

## Basilisk Considerations
The Basilisk variant has a top speed of 530m/s. The doctrine chieftain can not outrun the Basilisk if followed to the fitting. A required maneuver of a cold boost (engaging a heat sink before boosting 180 degrees past the Basilisk) will allow you to gain valuable distance from the Basilisk to allow you to synthesize more heat sinks or ammo or perform any repairs to your ship before committing to your next combat loop. The Basilisk does not do well when it has to adjust its momentum from one direction to the opposite. Do take in mind this will put you in the path of the swarm also triggering its agitated state if you fly through it.

# Swarm Management
The purpose of engaging the swarm first on the initial engagement is to remove the “banked” swarm of the Interceptor from the equation. Whenever an Interceptor is engaged and the heart is destroyed first, the banked swarm will then launch forcing the commander to have to deal with a second swarm. Removing the banked swarm from the equation will allow the commander to efficiently use his time to focus on all subsequent hearts.

# Cold Orbit Purpose
- The Cold Orbit has the advantage of preventing all of the damage from the Interceptor if proper speed and orbit distance is maintained with the proper 15 degrees arc past the center bore of the Interceptor's cannons with your ship heat below 20%. This tactic is used by many veteran AX commanders to prevent any sort of damage done to their ship allowing them to continue their engagement and preventing from having to repair modules which may take up precious time, especially in the more advanced Interceptors.
-
- Cold orbiting is also the basis for more advanced Interceptor combat when wanting to use smaller ships and also for more advanced Thargon swarm management for small ships when flak launchers cannot be fitted. (beyond the scope of this guide)
-
- The amount of heat sinks within this doctrine will allow the destruction of any heart on any variants as long as the commander maintains a 900m-1.5km orbit maximising the damage output of the Gauss cannon.

Being outside of the orbit envelope may cost extra rounds from the Gauss cannons due to damage drop off and a waste of heat sinks will occur. Firing outside the engagement envelope is ill advised.

# Thargoid Sleep Mode
