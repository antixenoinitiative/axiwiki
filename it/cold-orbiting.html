<h1 id="cold-orbiting" class="toc-header"> Cold Orbiting</h1><div>
</div><p>Cold orbiting is a technique used mainly with <strong>small</strong> and <strong>medium</strong> ships to avoid damage from the Interceptor’s main cannon. Cold Orbiting relies upon using heatsinks to stay cold while moving in an orbiting motion around the interceptor, a Thargoid cannot hit you with their main gun when:</p><div>
</div><ol>
<li>You are moving perpendicular to the Thargoid’s facing direction with sufficient speed.</li>
<li>Your ship’s effective heat is below 20% (Heatsinks, Thermal Vent Beam or Silent Running)</li>
</ol><div>
</div><p>Cold orbiting can be used in different phases of the fight, While waiting for a shield to drop, cold orbiting can be maintained with a Thermal Vent Beam. During a Gauss attack run you will require constant heatsinks to avoid going above 20% heat.</p><div>
</div><p>To effectively cold orbit, you will need to be able to comfortably fly in <strong>Flight Assist Off</strong> mode.</p><div>
</div><p>This technique is mainly for medium or small ships, large ships will struggle to maintain the necessary speed and agility to orbit. However, it is possible to enter a partial orbit in some large ships (such as the Corvette), allowing you to avoid at least some of the damage.</p><div>
</div><h2 id="managing-heat" class="toc-header"> Managing Heat</h2><div>
</div><p>In order to keep control of your heat here are a few tips:</p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>
<p>Always use heatsinks when firing Gauss. This will prevent your heat from going above 20% (deploy a heatsink when your previous one ejects, at minimum)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split your Gauss firegroups in half, firing 2x Gauss cannons at a time. This will prevent the heat from temporarily spiking above 20% allowing the goid to hit you. (if done fast enough this can be done without losing appreciable DPS)</p>
</li>
</ul><div>
