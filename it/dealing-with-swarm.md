# Dealing with the Swarm

The Thargon Swarm is a major component of most Thargoid Interceptors' kit. Knowing how to deal with it is important to combat Interceptors effectively.

This article contains several methods to deal with the swarm, but to fully grasp them it is advisable to learn the full mechanics and behavior of the swarm first.

There are several of ways to destroy the swarm during an Interceptor fight. Many commanders choose to fly without flak at some point, but it is advisable to start out using flak and then making the decision on what style or techniques you want to transition to later on.

A swarm can be kept in the Standard state for the entire duration of the fight. This means that agile ships such as the chieftain (particularly shieldless versions) can avoid using flak altogether. The low accuracy of the swarm’s caustic projectiles against shieldless targets combined with the lack of Thargon Missiles eliminates the threat that the swarm presents.

If the swarm at any point enters an Agitated state, one can bait the missiles before boosting through the swarm, reverting it back to the Standard state.

# Techniques & Counters

This is a list of general methods of dealing with the Swarms behavior and mechanics during an Interceptor fight. These can used in a variety of scenarios by both beginners and advanced pilots.

## The Reverski

Traveling in a certain direction, in Flight Assist OFF, while having the ship face backwards.
A good and reliable maneuver to kite interceptors and their swarms.

**Passing the Interceptor to put the swarm between you and the interceptor.**

1. Turn FA-Off, face straight away from the interceptor, make sure the Interceptor right behind you on your Radar.

2. Transfer pips to ENG, throttle forwards and boost away.
   Keep boosting until you are at the maximum range you can be without the Interceptor losing interest.
   Typically around 6 - 7.5km in most ships.

3. Flip your ship and face in the opposite direction of your movement vector.
   You want to keep moving away while facing your pursuers, so make sure you do NOT accidently throttle forwards after you flip the ship, as this would cancel your current movement.

4. You can now fire your flak, beams or employ other techniques.
   Keep an eye on your distance to the interceptor so it doesn't get too close.

## Missile Baiting

The easiest and most effective way to un-agitate a Swarm and avoiding the missile-strike safely!

- Gain more than 3km range from the swarm
- Enter Reverski, allow it to catch up slowly (missile formation moves at around 360m/s when near firing range) and once it is within 3km the missiles will begin to fire.
- Maintain distance of 2.5 - 2.9km, reversing at around 300m/s - the missiles will expire before reaching you.
- Follow this up with a boost through the swarm after it reverts to a non-missile formation.

Mind that accidently going beyond 3km range mid-missile barrage will interrupt it! Slowly enter <2.9km range again and let the missile barrage finish **before** you boost through the Swarm!

## Swarm Rerolling

You can use the Interceptors recalling behavior to your advantage to reroll the current Swarm formation into a different, maybe more desirable, one.

- Move to a medium distance (depending on ship 4-6km) and stay cold via silent running or heatsinks, do not beam the Interceptor.
- After a while the Interceptor should lose track of you, it will recall the swarm in preperation to leave.
  The recall will cause the Swarm to break formation. Wait until the Swarm gets closer to its mothership, then gain back the attention of the interceptor by exiting silent-running, heating up or beaming it.
- Make sure you act fast - you do not want the Interceptor to leave the Instance by waking out!

After you regained the attention the swarm will change into a regular formation again. It _can_ roll the same as the previous one, but with any luck you rolled a new formation!

## Switching Interceptor and Swarm Position / Boost Pass

In some cases, such as when the player is too far away from the Interceptor when the swarm is released (beyond 6km), the swarm will stay behind the Interceptor and engaging it will be impossible without taking fire from the Interceptor.
This can also commonly happen with the Basilisk, which is faster than the swarm and can overtake it.

To switch their positions, boost past the Interceptor (but not directly at it). Its inertia will cause it to drift away and take a long time to turn, while the swarm will make a much sharper turn.

# Destroying the Swarm

The only effective weapon against the Swarm is the remote release Flak Launcher. All techniques to destroy the Swarm require this weapon to be fitted.

## How to use the Flak Launcher

The remote release Flak Launcher only comes in the class 2 hardpoint size. Choose the fixed variant.
After firing the weapon you hold down and then release to detonate it.

> Set your games targeting sights to "Leading" when using flak.
> {.is-info}

During traveltime the flak projectile will have a visual targeting indicator made up of a circle and 3 triangle corners.

As the projectile aproaches targets in its blast radius, the circle will fill and the corners will light up. There is also a beeping audio que. You may need to adjust your release timing based on distance, closing speeds, and your own reaction time. The released flak will destroy any thargons in a short area of effect.

Your leading sights indicator will generally provide you with information to estimate where the swarm is heading and where you should fire your flak projectile.

### Medium Range flakking

When you are within ~ 3.5 kilometer range of the swarm it will move in an oscillating pattern while attempting to get closer and fire upon you. During this, the swarm will have peaks and valleys in its swaying motion before changing direction. The thargons change of direction is an ideal window of opportunity to hit them, as they will spend the most time at that position.

To hit the flak more consistently you want to fire your flak to where you **predict** the swarms sway will be peaking. This will differ based on your range and angle.

An easy rule of thumb for beginners is **aiming about halfway** ~ or two thirds of the way between the center of the swarm and the leading sights indicator just after the swarm changed direction.

### Ring flakking

Rings are a swarm formation first used by the Medusa Interceptor and very common with both it and the  Hydra.
It is more difficult to hit flak on, because of the hollow area in the center, flak shots need to be aimed and predicted off-center to hit the outer rim of the ring reliably.

A good trick for beginners is **offsetting your aim** by the radius of the ring and then imagining columns or lines that are aligned **parallel to the direction of movement** the swarm currently has. Predicting your shot along these lines, similarly to the rule of thumb mentioned above, will increase your hitrate on the thargons positioned on the outer ring rather than empty space.

## Painbeavering

A more advanced technique. Not recommended for less experienced AX pilots..

Involves agitating the swarm on purpose and then chasing it down. This comes with some risk as failure means you end up with an agitated swarm, all while often being in the immediate vicinity of the Interceptor and its weapons.
This technique however does avoid having to flak more difficult Ring-formations on higher tier interceptors, as you force it into an easier form to hit.

- Fly through the swarm, agitating it in the process
- Flip your ship and chase the swarm
- The swarm will break formation and enter its clustered "idle / retreat" mode, while attempting to gain a 2 kilometer distance from you in order for it to switch to missile mode.
- Fire your flak at the straightlining swarm while you keep chasing it.
  Consider the swarms movement away from you as you trigger the flak - hold a bit longer than you are used to before release, to ensure the shrapnel hits as many thargons as possible.

It is one of the few ways in that slow ships (notably the ‘Vette, but also the ‘Conda and FGS) can effectively deal with the swarm.
But it can also be employed by faster ships to deal with the swarm quickly and effectively.

Named after CMDR Painbeaver.

  Note that a shield-ram is not necessary to use this technique to get rid of a swarm - but it is often paired with it by experienced commanders to accelerate a fight.
