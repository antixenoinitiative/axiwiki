<h1>Gibbing (Insta-gib)</h1>
<p>Gibbing (Instagibbing) is the term referring to the use of overwhelming firepower to destroy a Thargoid Interceptor before its defenses can react. By attacking a Thargoid with sufficient firepower it is possible to reduce the Interceptorâ€™s hull to 0 faster than the health regeneration can heal. Typically this requires a large number of Pilots to all attack the Interceptor simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is also possible to Gib a Cyclops with a single CMDR, however this only works with <strong>4x Large Shard Cannons</strong> and <strong>Premium Ammo.</strong></p>
