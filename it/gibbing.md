# Gibbing (Insta-gib)

Gibbing (Insta-gib or Instagibbing) is the term referring to the use of overwhelming alpha damage to destroy a Thargoid Interceptor before it can deploy defensive shields. By attacking a Thargoid with sufficient firepower it is possible to reduce the Interceptorâ€™s hull to 0 faster than the health regeneration can heal and before the interceptor can deploy panic shields. Typically, this requires a number of Pilots to all attack the interceptor simultaneously.

It is also possible to Gib a Cyclops by a single commander. This can be done with **4x Large Shard Cannons** with synthed **Premium Ammo** or any equivalent like **6x Modified Medium Shard Cannons** with basic ammo as exhibited by the Shard-Conda.
