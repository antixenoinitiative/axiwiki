# Speedrun Builds

> These ship builds are not recommended for pilots new to Anti-Xeno Content, they require a solid understanding of Thargoid mechanics to truly succeed. Click [here](/en/builds) to see our recommended builds for regular AX.

There are several differences between a general-purpose AX build and a speedrunner - they key difference being the focus of survivability and versatility in general builds, whereas speedrun builds can be highly specific to a particular variant and often forego self-repair capabilities, instead focusing on lasting just long enough to complete the kill.

- Since these fights are short and intense, repair limpets do not have the time to return the hull that is sacrificed to equip a controller and cargo rack, and AFMUs may not be necessary.
- Shields, while offering excellent protection from ramming damage, are useless if utilizing Silent Running - an extremely valuable tool in the speedrunner's arsenal.
- Shutdown Field Neutralizers can be useful as some techniques involve triggering the EMP/Caustics on purpose to accelerate the fight.
- Thermal vent beam lasers are less important as the builds can rely on Silent Running for short periods of time, and there is almost no kiting involved in these fights

Note that there are roughly 2 main types of speedruns:

- **Regular Speedruns** - Faster paced combat, sometimes with the use of more nuanced techniques, with the willingness to expend as much ammo and health as needed to get the kill as fast as possible.
- **Stunlocks** - Relies heavily on the sleepphase of an Interceptor with the goal to kill it as fast as possible while avoiding an open-fielded fight.

These are not mutually exclusive, but some speedrunning builds are built to specialise on one over the other.
