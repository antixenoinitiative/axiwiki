# Predicting NHSS content via FSS tuning

Lead Researchers: CMDR Mechan, CMDR Xarionn

The NHSS spectrum can be divided in 3 categories, left | middle | right :

- Signals showing up on the left side of the spectrum will always contain scouts or scouts + interceptor.
- Signals showing up on the middle of the spectrum will contain everything, scouts, scouts + interceptor, interceptor…
- Signals showing up on the right side of the spectrum will always contain interceptor or empty instances.

By using this technique, it is possible to predict and map all NHSS showing up on the FSS, here is an example :

- Left side of the spectrum:

- Right side of the spectrum

- Middle of the spectrum
