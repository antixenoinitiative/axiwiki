## Using AXI Wiki
Tags: Navigation, Nav, How-to

As part of navigating AXI Wiki, the left bar is a collection of links with two view modes; **Browse** which lists all AXI Wiki pages alphabetically, and **Menu** which organizes most of the AXI Wiki pages into groups; Main, Guides, Thargoids, Outfitting, Tools, and Studies. Switch between navigation modes by clicking the button next to the Home icon:
![navigation_bar_sample.gif](/img/navigation_bar_sample.gif)

All wiki pages have a selection of tags associated with them which can be used to filter by topic, click the **Browse Tags** icon located to the right of the **Search Bar**. Short width browsers will hide the icon.

> NOTE: Page tags cannot be searched by the search bar tool; only **Browse Tags** tool can use tags for navigation filtering. {.is-info}

In many wiki pages, hyperlink text is used to navigate to additional content, but they look a bit different from your standard hyperlinks, with blue text and blue underlines. Hyperlinks look just like [this]() and can hide very long urls as in the case of this link to this [quick-start guide](/en/quick-start-guide) which is the same as <https://wiki.antixenoinitiative.com/en/quick-start-guide>. There have already been a few examples; however, please understand text is often emphasized using the same **orange** styling as a hyperlink without the underline.

## Getting Started Anti-Xeno Protocol

### Step 1 - Know Thy Enemy

If you are new to anti-xeno combat or operations, then the first priority should be to learn to identify the enemy. Head to [Thargoids](/en/thargoids) wiki page and pay attention to the "Thargoid Encounters" section. Come back here when ready for the next steps; setup and maneuvering.

### Step 2 - Configuring Controls

>"This is a game for which almost all of its content is centered around 'Player controls a ship to...' How you setup your control scheme and utilize it is almost the entirety of the game. It's important, and you are responsible for the control scheme you are fighting against. Good luck!"
> -- *From CMDR Toscany* {.is-info}

AXI wiki presumes that its audience is most interested in combat. All wiki recommendations for controls and outfitting are going to have Thargoid combat as the basis of its advice. 

Visit [Recommended Controls](/en/recommended-controls) to get started with a control scheme that prioritizes precision aim. Your maneuvering should facilitate Time on Target (ToT) and your fine yaw and pitch controls become your bread and butter for bringing home the kills. Next up is maneuvering and then targeting.

### Step 3 - Learn to Fly

Thargoids that have engaged in combat are merciless. Survival is dependent on the pilot's ability to maneuver out of the way of incoming fire. Many strategies can be employed to great success. Regardless of the pilot's build strategy, an understanding and practice of [Cold Orbiting](/en/cold-orbiting) will assist to ensure the survival of the pilot during any Thargoid encounter.

### Step 4 - Learn to Disengage

Whether in a small, medium, or large ship, flight strategies should be considered to get into and out of combat with thargoids. Understanding when to run and how, can save the pilot precious rebuy funds and cargo. If things start to go sour in an encounter, you can and should disengage, seek repair, and try again.

### Step 5 - Learn to Fight

Once you know how to survive in the event of a Thargoid encounter, you gain options for going on the offensive. Visit [Advanced Combat Guide](/en/advanced-combat-guide) to get an introduction to a successful offensive strategy to combat with Thargoids.
