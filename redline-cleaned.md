# Thargoids

*The **Thargoids** are a nonhuman race with a history of hostility towards humanity.*

*The first recorded encounter with a Thargoid ship took place in 2849, although earlier undocumented encounters are believed to have taken place. In the years that followed, contact with lone Thargoid vessels was intermittently reported.*

*Humanity clashed with the Thargoids in the 32nd century, but details of the conflict remained scarce for many years, and it proved difficult to differentiate authentic accounts of Thargoid encounters from the sensationalist media stories of the time.*

*Entry from Elite Dangerous Codex*

## Thargoid Vessels

Thargoids come in 5 known classes: the Titan, interceptor, hunter, scout, and ground variant.

Thargoid **Titans** are large capital class Thargoid vessels, and can be found at the center of Maelstroms. Thargoid planetary structures surface sites, and barnacle matrix sites also bear many similarities to the Titans found in space. Read more about these on the [**Maelstrom**](/en/Maelstrom)

Thargoid [**Interceptors**](/en/interceptors) come in five variants: Orthrus, Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa and Hydra, in ascending level of difficulty. Each next variant has more [**hearts**](/en/hearts) and is tougher than the last, requiring more damage destroy them. The Orthrus is a special class of interceptor without hearts. Interceptors use very high damage output weapons, crowd-control style special abilities and [**Thargon drone swarms**](/en/thargon-swarms) to wreak havoc on the battlefield.

Thargoid **Hunters** are the newest class spotted, and come in two variants: Glaives and Scythes. Hunters have very high mobility, fire FSD disruptor and caustic missiles, and deploy an anti-guardian field similar to the Orthrus.

Thargoid [**Scouts**](/en/scouts) are a smaller variant of the Thargoid interceptor. They come in four variants: Berserker, Inciter, Marauder, and Regenerator. Each with different special abilities. Read more about these in the [**Thargoid Scouts**](/en/scouts) section.

Thargoid ground variants come in two forms: **Revenants** and **Scavengers**. Scavengers maintain and protect Thargoid structures. Revenants are found at barnacle matrices and occupy human ground bases in Controlled systems.

 Thargoid Interceptors have incredibly strong armour and fast regeneration capabilities, this makes conventional weapons (Multi-cannons, Missiles, Plasma Accelerators, Lasers, etc.) completely ineffective at damaging them. Even Hunters and Scouts still have a high resistance to conventional weaponry. Thankfully humanity has not only developed their own line of Anti-Xeno (AX) weaponry, but we have also adapted the ancient Guardian technology into very powerful hybrid weapons and modules that are far more effective at destroying Thargoid vessels.
 
Attempting Thargoid combat with the appropriate defenses, weaponry, and strategy is paramount to ensuring success and help avoid the rebuy screen.
