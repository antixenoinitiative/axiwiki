# Thargoids

*The **Thargoids** are a nonhuman race with a history of hostility towards humanity.*

*The first recorded encounter with a Thargoid ship took place in 2849, although earlier undocumented encounters are believed to have taken place. In the years that followed, contact with lone Thargoid vessels was intermittently reported.*

*Humanity clashed with the Thargoids in the 32nd century, but details of the conflict remained scarce for many years, and it proved difficult to differentiate authentic accounts of Thargoid encounters from the sensationalist media stories of the time.*

*Entry from Elite Dangerous Codex*

## Thargoid Vessels

Thargoids come in 5 known <RL>size</RL> classes: Titans, Interceptors, Hunters, Glaives, and ground variants.

Thargoid **Titans** are capital class Thargoid vessels, and can be found in the center of Maelstroms. Thargoid ground bases also bear many similarities to the Titans found in space, so they may be related.

Thargoid [**Interceptors**](/en/interceptors) come in five variants: Orthrus, Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa and Hydra, in ascending level of difficulty. Each next variant has more [**hearts**](/en/hearts) and is tougher than the last, requiring far more damage to exert and destroy hearts. The Orthrus is a special class of interceptor, with no offensive capabilities.
Interceptors are incredibly tough and typically are best suited to wing combat as soloing them is a huge achievement. Interceptors use very high damage output weapons, crowd-control style special abilities and large [**thargon drone swarms**](/en/thargon-swarms) to wreak havoc on the battlefield.

Thargoid **Hunters** are the newest class spotted, and currently only come in one variant: Glaives. These Glaives have a very high acceleration, fire FSD disruptor and caustic missiles, deploy an anti-guardian field similar to the Orthrus, and are not deterred by low heat. 

Thargoid [**Scouts**](/en/scouts) are a smaller variant of the Thargoid interceptor, they come in multiple types with different special abilities. Read more about these in the Thargoid [**Scouts**](/en/scouts) section.

Thargoid **Revenants** and **Scavengers** are the only known Thargoid ground forces. Scavengers maintain and protect Thargoid ground bases, while Revenants occupy human ground bases in Controlled systems, eliminating any intruders.

Attempting to fight a Thargoid without the appropriate weaponry and defenses is nigh-impossible, Thargoid Interceptors have incredibly strong armour and fast regeneration capabilities, this makes conventional weapons (such as Multi-cannons, Missiles, Plasma Accelerators, Lasers) completely ineffective at damaging them. Even Hunters and Scouts still have a high resistance to conventional weaponry.

Thankfully humanity has not only developed their own line of AX (Anti-Xeno) weaponry, but we have also adapted the ancient Guardian technology into very powerful hybrid weapons and modules that are far more effective at destroying Thargoid vessels.
