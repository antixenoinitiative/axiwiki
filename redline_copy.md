# Thargoids
![cyclops-small.png](/img/Cyclops-small.png =250x){.align-right}
*The **Thargoids** are a nonhuman race with a history of hostility towards humanity.*

*The first recorded encounter with a Thargoid ship took place in 2849, although earlier undocumented encounters are believed to have taken place. In the years that followed, contact with lone Thargoid vessels was intermittently reported.*

*Humanity clashed with the Thargoids in the 32nd century, but details of the conflict remained scarce for many years, and it proved difficult to differentiate authentic accounts of Thargoid encounters from the sensationalist media stories of the time.*

*Entry from Elite Dangerous Codex*

## Thargoid Vessels

Thargoids come in 5 known <RL>size</RL> classes: <Nwt>the </NwT>Titan, Interceptor, Hunter, <RL>Glaives</RL> <NwT>Scout</Nwt>, and ground variant.

Thargoid **Titans** are <NwT>large</NwT> capital class Thargoid vessels, and can be found <RL>in</RL><NwT>at</NwT> the center of Maelstroms. Thargoid <RL>ground bases</RL><NwT> planetary structures, surface sites, and barnacle matrix sites</NwT> also bear many similarities to the Titans found in space.<RL>, so they may be related.</RL> <NwT>Read more about these on the</NwT> [**Maelstrom**](/en/Maelstrom)

Thargoid [**Interceptors**](/en/interceptors) come in five variants: Orthrus, Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa and Hydra, in ascending level of difficulty. Each next variant has more [**hearts**](/en/hearts) and is tougher than the last, requiring <RL>far</RL> more damage <RL>to exert and </RL>destroy <RL>hearts</RL><NwT> them</NwT>. The Orthrus is a special class of interceptor<RL>, with no offensive capabilities</RL> <NwT>without hearts.</NwT>
<RL>Interceptors are incredibly tough and typically are best suited to wing combat as soloing them is a huge achievement.</RL> Interceptors use very high damage output weapons, crowd-control style special abilities and <RL>large</RL> [**Thargon drone swarms**](/en/thargon-swarms) to wreak havoc on the battlefield.

Thargoid **Hunters** are the newest class spotted, and <RL>currently only</RL> come in <RL>one</RL><NwT>two</Nwt> variant<NwT>s</NwT>: Glaives and <NwT>Scythes</NwT>. <RL>These Glaives have a very high acceleration</RL><NwT>Hunters have very high mobility</NwT>, fire FSD disruptor and caustic missiles, deploy an anti-guardian field similar to the Orthrus<NwT>.</NwT><RL>, and are not deterred by low heat.</RL> 

Thargoid [**Scouts**](/en/scouts) are a smaller variant of the Thargoid interceptor<NwT>.</NwT> They come in <RL>multiple types</RL><NwT> four variants: Berserker, Inciter, Marauder, and Regenerator. Each </Nwt>with different special abilities. Read more about these in the [**Thargoid Scouts**](/en/scouts) section.

Thargoid <NwT>ground variants come in two forms: </NwT>**Revenants** and **Scavengers** <RL>are the only known Thargoid ground forces</RL>. Scavengers maintain and protect Thargoid <RL>ground bases</RL><NwT>structures.</NwT><RL>while</RL> Revenants <NwT>are found at barnacle matrices and </NwT>occupy human ground bases in Controlled systems <RL>, eliminating any intruders.</RL>

 Thargoid Interceptors have incredibly strong armour and fast regeneration capabilities, this makes conventional weapons (such as Multi-cannons, Missiles, Plasma Accelerators, Lasers) completely ineffective at damaging them. Even Hunters and Scouts still have a high resistance to conventional weaponry. Thankfully humanity has not only developed their own line of AX (Anti-Xeno) weaponry, but we have also adapted the ancient Guardian technology into very powerful hybrid weapons and modules that are far more effective at destroying Thargoid vessels.
 
Attempting <RL>to fight a</RL> Thargoid<NwT> combat</NwT> with<RL>out</RL> the appropriate weaponry<NwT>,</NwT><RL> and</RL> defenses<NwT>, and strategy</NwT> <RL>is nigh-impossible,</RL> <NwT>is paramount to ensuring success and help avoid the rebuy screen.</NwT>
