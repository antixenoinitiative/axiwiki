<p>This page contains a list of “cursed builds” I or others have used, or tried to use, in AX combat, with varying degrees of success. It is not intended for beginners, and is not intended for general purpose use - as many of these are min/maxed builds that can do little else besides the one fight they were designed for.</p>
<p>Throughout these examples, I will also try to explain the concepts and principles which went into their (often highly unconventional) designs.</p>
