# Convergence
Convergence is a term commonly used in regards to how well fixed weapons converge on the enemy target. For example, a very wide ship with weapons on each wing-tip may have very poor convergence because the hardpoints are very far apart from each other.

This becomes very important when using weapons that do not have any gimbal/turreted or automatic adjustment (micro-gimbal, such as small Gauss).

In AX combat, it is important that your weapons (Gauss in particular) have a very small convergence area. This will allow all of your weapons to be able to hit a small target (like a Thargoid Heart) simultaneously.

You can place weapons in hardpoints that are physically close together to improve convergence.

## Good Convergence
These hardpoints have a very tight convergence.

## Bad Convergence
The outer hardpoints on the cutter have very poor convergence.
