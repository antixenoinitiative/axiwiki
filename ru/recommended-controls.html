<h1>Recommended Controls Scheme</h1>
<p><strong>Keyboard and mouse provides superior control to HOTAS.</strong> This is well known amongst the PVP community, and the same holds true for Thargoid hunting. The ability to decouple your flight vector from your attack vector is paramount. A commonly used AX tactic requires maintaining a heat signature below 20% and a high angular velocity relative to the interceptor. This results in dramatically diminished aim of the interceptor’s main cannon. Without FA-off, it is nearly impossible to keep the interceptor in your weapon’s field of fire while maintaining a flight path that does not bring you dangerously close to the interceptor, or kill your angular velocity to the interceptor.</p>
<p>The following are recommended mouse settings which <strong>enable relative mouse control</strong> (the cursor returns to the center of the reticule without player input). This dramatically increases your aim because it makes it easier to make small adjustments in FA-off. <strong>Rebind yaw to mouse X axis and roll to the Q and E for QWERTY keyboards or A and D for AZERTY keyboards.</strong> Ensure that <strong>flight assist is</strong> <strong>set to toggle</strong>.<strong> </strong>Maneuvering in this mode in supercruise is tedious. Try binding alternative yaw and pitch to the numpad.</p>
<p><i>Although KBM typically the most precise input form, you may find a different setup is more suited to yourself, find what works for you, experiment!</i></p>
