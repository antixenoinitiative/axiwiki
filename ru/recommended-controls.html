<h1>Recommended Controls Scheme</h1>
<p><strong>Keyboard and mouse provides superior control to HOTAS.</strong> This is well known amongst the PVP community, and the same holds true for Thargoid hunting. The ability to decouple your flight vector from your attack vector is paramount. A commonly used AX tactic requires maintaining a heat signature below 20% and a high angular velocity relative to the interceptor. This results in dramatically diminished aim of the interceptor’s main cannon. Without FA-off, it is nearly impossible to keep the interceptor in your weapon’s field of fire while maintaining a flight path that does not bring you dangerously close to the interceptor, or kill your angular velocity to the interceptor.</p>
<p>For those new to anti-xeno or combat in general, there are a number of binds which are necessary for Thargoid combat that may not be easily accessible or bound at all without doing it manually. These binds will be used regularly and should be comfortable to reach from a neutral hand position over thrust controls, or from your mouse.</p>
<p>On top of the standard thruster binds you will need</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cycle next fire group and/or Cycle previous fire group (only one is necessary but both is nice)</li>
  <li>Silent running</li>
  <li>Deploy heatsink</li>
  <li>All pip management binds</li>
  <li>Shutdown field neutralizer (for builds that include it)</li>
  <li>Flight assist</li>
  <li>Boost</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are recommended mouse settings which <strong>enable relative mouse control</strong> (the cursor returns to the center of the reticule without player input). This dramatically increases your aim because it makes it easier to make small adjustments in FA-off. <strong>Rebind yaw to mouse X axis and roll to the Q and E for QWERTY keyboards or A and D for AZERTY keyboards.</strong> Ensure that <strong>flight assist is</strong> <strong>set to toggle</strong>.<strong> </strong>Maneuvering in this mode in supercruise is tedious. Try binding alternative yaw and pitch to the numpad.</p>
<p><i>Although KBM is typically the most precise input form, you may find a different setup is more suited to yourself, find what works for you, experiment!</i></p>
