# Synthesis
For extended combat scenarios it is recommended that you bring materials for synthesizing more ammunition. We recommend carrying at least a few of the most important synths for each fight, nothing is more frustrating than having to leave a potential kill because you ran out of ammo.

Solo Hydra will require at least 2-3 full Gauss synths for each hardpoint.

## Synthesis Panel

Access the synthesis panel on the in-game UI through the following steps:

`Right Panel > Inventory > Second Last Menu > Synthesis Panel`

# Optional Internals and Utilities{.tabset}

## AFM Refills
In longer fights, you will need to refill your AFMU multiple times to keep your Module Reinforcements and other modules at full integrity.

We recommend only using Basic AFM refills, as standard and premium cost too much to be worth it. Standard and Premium are not shown here

### Basic
- 2x Nickel
- 2x Zinc
- 2x Chromium
- 3x Vanadium

## Heatsinks

Heatsinks are critical for reducing your ship's temperature to safe ranges while firing extended gauss volleys or avoiding damage with cold tactics.

We recommend only using Basic heatsink synths as there is no useful benefit to standard or premium. Standard and Premium not shown here.

### Basic
- 2x Basic Conductors
- 2x Heat Conduction Wiring

## Caustic Sink Launchers
Whether in active Spire sites, live Titan space, or AXCZs, a caustic sink launcher is handy for absorbing caustic sources before the source is allowed to deal hull damage.

### Basic
- 1x Chemical Storage Units
- 1x Galvanising Alloys
- 4x Caustic Shard
- 2x Corrosive Mechanisms

# Hardpoint Synthesis - Human AX{.tabset}

## Remote Release Flak

Required to deal with Thargon swarms, expect to use a few synths for Basilisk and higher fights. We recommend only using Basic Flak synths as there is no tangible benefit to standard or premium. Standard and Premium not shown here.

### Basic

- 4x Nickel
- 3x Carbon
- 2x Sulfur

## AX Multicannons
AX Small Calibre Munitions - Standard and Premium synthesis should not be used.

### Basic
- 2x Iron
- 1x Nickel
- 2x Sulphur
- 2x Weapon Parts

### Standard (+5% Damage)
- 2x Iron
- 2x Phosphorus
- 2x Zirconium
- 3x Sensor Fragments
- 4x Weapon Parts

### Premium (+10% Damage)
- 3x Iron
- 2x Phosphorus
- 2x Zirconium
- 4x Sensor Fragments
- 2x Thargoid Carapace
- 6x Weapon Parts

## AX Missile Racks
AX Explosive Munitions - Standard and Premium synthesis should not be used.

### Basic
- 3x Iron
- 3x Nickel
- 4x Carbon
- 3x Propulsion Elements

### Standard (+5% Damage)
- 6x Sulphur
- 6x Phosphorus
- 2x Mercury
- 4x Thargoid Organic Circuitry
- 4x Propulsion Elements

### Premium (+10% Damage)
- 5x Tungsten
- 4x Mercury
- 2x Polonium
- 5x Bio-mechanical Conduits
- 5x Propulsion Elements
- 6x Ship Flight Data

## Advanced Missile Rack
This MR is not an AX hardpoint; however, Configurable Explosive Munitions will add AX damage to it using standard synthesis. The Advanced Missile Rack is not recommended for any AX activities.

### Standard (Applies Anti-Xeno Damage)
- 6x Phosphorus
- 4x Arsenic
- 2x Mercury
- 1x Guardian Power Cell
- 1x Guardian Power Conduit
- 1x Guardian Technology Component

# Hardpoint Synthesis - Guardian AX{.tabset}

## Guardian Gauss Cannon
Also applies to Modified Guardian Gauss Cannon.

Guardian Gauss Cannons are currently the most effective AX weapon and due to their low ammo total we recommend carrying a few synths for solo Medusa and higher.

Premium Gauss Synths are strongly recommended for Hydra variant Interceptors.

### Basic

- 2x Focus Crystals
- 2x Guardian Power Conduit
- 3x Manganese
- 4x Guardian Wreckage Components

### Standard (+15% dmg)

- 3x Heat Resistant Ceramics
- 3x Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts
- 4x Guardian Power Conduits
- 5x Manganese
- 5x Focus Crystals

### Premium (+30% dmg)

- 6x Filament Composites
- 6x Guardian Technology Components
- 8x Manganese
- 10x Focus Crystals

For the maximum possible Premium Gauss synths you will need:

- 200x Focus Crystals
- 160x Manganese
- 120x Filament Composites
- 120x Guardian Tech Components

## Guardian Plasma Charger

Guardian Plasma Chargers are currently one of the most effective AX weapons. While the modified variants have a lot of ammo, packing synths never hurts.

### Basic

- 3x Chromium
- 2x Heat Dispersion Plate
- 3x Guardian Power Conduit
- 4x Guardian Wreckage Components

### Standard (+15% dmg)

- 4x Chromium
- 2x Heat Exchangers
- 2x Phase Alloys
- 2x Guardian Power Cell
- 2x Guardian Technology Component

### Premium (+30% dmg)

- 6x Chromium
- 2x Zirconium
- 4x Heat Exchangers
- 6x Phase Alloys
- 4x Guardian Power Cell
- 3x Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts

## Guardian Shard Cannon
Guardian Shard Cannons are currently one of the most effective AX weapons. While the modified variants have a lot of ammo, packing synths never hurts.

### Basic

- 3x Carbon
- 2x Vanadium
- 3x Crystal Shards
- 3x Guardian Power Cell
- 5x Guardian Wreckage Components

### Standard (+15% dmg)

- 4x Crystal Shards
- 2x Guardian Power Cell
- 2x Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts

### Premium (+30% dmg)

- 8x Carbon
- 6x Guardian Power Cell
- 4x Vanadium
- 8x Crystal Shards

## Nanite Torpedo Pylon
Torpedoes are only useful at live Titans on vents although they can lock on to many other entities. Synthing Nanite munitions is not common practice.

### Basic

- 2x Guardian Power Cell
- 5x Heat Exposure Specimen
- 5x Phasing Membrane Residue
