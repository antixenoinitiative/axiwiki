# Salvation Gauss Cannons
Salvation Gauss Cannons are a modified version of the Guardian Gauss Cannon, these will be available as part of the Salvation Storyline (and in the future) in elite.

The weapons are first mentioned in a message from Salvation on 17th Sept 3307: 

> You have performed well in my service before, and now i require your help again. This is an urgent matter, with millions of lives at risk. 
> 
> I ask you to travel to the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system immediately. There you will find the megaship Heart of Taurus, operated by my partners at Taurus Mining Ventures. From there you must collect basic medicines, and deliver them to either of the rescue ships in the Cornsar system. They need to arrive betore Monday the 20th of September if they are to be of use.
> 
> I am trusting you with the knowledge that these shipments have been disguised as medicines. but actually contain vital components for a prototype anti xeno weapon. With enough deliveries, I may be able to eliminate the Thargoid fleet currently causing havoc in Cornsar.
> 
> Naturally. I offer generous compensation for this tan On Thursday the 23rd of September you will be granted a permit to enter the Mbooni system where another megaship, the Bright Sentinel. will have a module waiting for you in storage. This is a modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Cannon with increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range.
> 
> As you know, we cannot rely on Aegis to save us from the Thargoids. Only I am capable of achieving this, and courageous pilots like you can ensure my triumph.

## Notes from Frontier

The following information is taken from Discussions with CM Zac in the [Anti-Xeno Initiative Discord](https://discord.gg/bqmDxdm).

- You don't need the message from Salvation to be able to participate.
- You don't need previous participation with Salvation events to participate.
- No specific "amount of medicines" required / commanders.
- The gauss will be obtainable later even if you didn't participate.
- You will be able to get as many "hammer gauss" as you want eventually.
