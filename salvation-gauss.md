# Salvation Gauss Cannons
Salvation Gauss Cannons are a modified version of the Guardian Gauss Cannon, these will be available as part of the Salvation Storyline (and in the future) in elite.

The weapons are first mentioned in a message from Salvation on 17th Sept 3307: 

> You have performed well in my service before, and now i require your help again. This is an urgent matter, with millions of lives at risk. 
> 
> I ask you to travel to the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system immediately. There you will find the megaship Heart of Taurus, operated by my partners at Taurus Mining Ventures. From there you must collect basic medicines, and deliver them to either of the rescue ships in the Cornsar system. They need to arrive betore Monday the 20th of September if they are to be of use.
> 
> I am trusting you with the knowledge that these shipments have been disguised as medicines. but actually contain vital components for a prototype anti xeno weapon. With enough deliveries, I may be able to eliminate the Thargoid fleet currently causing havoc in Cornsar.
> 
> Naturally. I offer generous compensation for this tan On Thursday the 23rd of September you will be granted a permit to enter the Mbooni system where another megaship, the Bright Sentinel. will have a module waiting for you in storage. This is a modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Cannon with increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range.
> 
> As you know, we cannot rely on Aegis to save us from the Thargoids. Only I am capable of achieving this, and courageous pilots like you can ensure my triumph.

This message was sent to a handful of commanders in-game. The current criteria to recieve this message is unknown.

A second announcement was made from The Heart of Taurus Megaship on the 19th of September 3307

> SYSTEM BROADCAST FROM HEART OF TAURUS MEGASHIP
> A message from Taurus Mining Ventures to all ships in the Pepsi Senior ON-S b4-8 system.
> 
> This is Captain Chae-Won Lee, commanding the Heart of Taurus. Our company nas been Contracted by Salvation to spearhead an operation against the Thargoids.
> 
> All independent pilots are requested to dock with this Megashlp. to collect as many units of basic medicines as possible. The cargo needs to be dellVered to either of the rescue ships in the Corns. System. It is Imperative that these deliveries are made before Monday me 20th of September.
> 
> These commodities are registered as medicinal goods to minimise inspection by the Cornsar autherlties. but In truth contain advanced technical components. Individually the shipments have little value, but sufncient quantities of them will enable Salvation's prototype anti-xeno weapon to become operational.
> 
> Taurus Mining Ventures has been authorised to reward those who support this initiative. Providing you have delivered the requested cargo. you will be granted entry to the permit-locked Mbooni system on Thursday the 23rd of September. 
> 
> A modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Gannon, which has increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range, will be offered as payment This will be waiting for you in storage at our sister ship, the Bright Sentinel.

## Notes from Frontier

The following information is taken from discussions with Community Manager Zac in the [Anti-Xeno Initiative Discord](https://discord.gg/bqmDxdm).

- You don't need the message from Salvation to be able to participate.
- You don't need previous participation with Salvation events to participate.
- No specific "amount of medicines" required / commanders.
- The gauss will be obtainable later even if you didn't participate.
- You will be able to get as many "hammer gauss" as you want eventually.
