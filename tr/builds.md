# Önerilen Gemiler
Thargoidlerin kendilerine has dirençleri ve hasar verme biçimleri alışılagelmiş savaş gemisi donanımları için sorun teşkil ettiğinden Thargoid Avı özelleşmiş gemi donanımları gerektirir. Uzaylı gemilerini yok etmek için gereken en etkili gemiyi oluştururken doğru kararları verebilmeniz için bu rehberi hazırladık. Bu gemiler size dengeli bir ateş gücü ve hayatta kalma imkanı verirken aynı zamanda daha fazla hata payı sağlamak için tasarlanmıştır.

## Gemi Donatım Biçimleri

İlk olarak iki ana çeşit Thargoid olduğundan bahsedelim: **Thargoid Scoutlar** ve **Thargoid Interceptorler**. Farklı mekanik ve yeteneklere sahip olduklarından, bu iki düşman karşısında farklı donanımlara ihtiyaç duyacağız.

# Interceptor Gemileri

Thargoid Interceptorler çok sağlam ve güçlü düşmanlardır ve baş edebilmek için eş seviyede güçlü gemilere ihtiyaç vardır. Thargoid Interceptorlerin yüksek hasar verme kabiliyetleri dolayısıyla etkili olabilecek yöntemler sınırlıdır.

Aşağıda Anti-Xeno savaşlarında en yaygın kullanılan gemi donatım biçimleri verilmiştir:

-   **Fast Shieldless Builds** (Cold Orbiters) - Fast ships that use no shield and cold mechanics to evade damage (Moderate)

-   **Slow Shielded Builds** (Shield Tanks) - Slow ships with large shields, using reboots to regenerate shields periodically (Moderate/Advanced)


## Başlangıç Seviyesi Gemiler

When starting out, stick to the tried and true. The Chieftain and the Krait have been the best ships for AX combat for a long time. The Chieftain offers exceptional agility paired with an excellent set of hardpoints. The Krait trades agility for tankiness and can run four medium AX weapons. The odd one out is the Imperial Cutter as a large shielded ship, offering an entirely different style of combat.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)

#### **Alliance Chieftain (Shieldless)**

The shieldless Alliance Chieftain is the undisputed AX meta, just like the Fer-de-Lance in PVP. Providing good hull, cargo space, agility, and firepower, the Chieftain is able to effortlessly cold orbit while maintaining devastating gauss fire. Its ample hardpoints also allow for four gauss cannons in addition to a flak launcher and thermal vent beam laser. Its sister ship, the Alliance Challenger, provides more damage and hull at the cost of speed.

Type: **Cold**

- Sürat: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Unarguably the best ship and build style for AX combat.

### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)

#### **Krait Mk.II (Shieldless)**

The shieldless Krait, while not as maneuverable as the Chieftain, provides a greater damage output for beginners. The Krait's massive power plant also allows it to idle under 20% heat, which allows for cold approaches without a heatsink or thermal vent beam.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Sürat: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: For people that like headroom on the distributor and don’t like yawing.

### Imperial Cutter (Kalkanlı)

#### **Imperial Cutter (Kalkanlı)**

If you prefer flying large ships the Imperial Cutter is the recommended ship to go with. Out of all the large ships, the Cutter is the only one capable of effectively outrunning most Thargoid Interceptors. The Cutter relies on Prismatic shields to tank large amounts of damage. If you intend to use the Cutter, we recommend reading the Anti-Xeno Large Ship Guide.

Type: **Shield Tank**

- Sürat: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Çeviklik: ⭐⭐
- Kalkan: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Zırh: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Ateş gücü: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: Different fighting style and generally very capable with weaker Interceptors. Becomes much harder for tougher variants.

## Orta Seviye Gemiler

These builds are targeted at more experienced commanders, either those who have flown the above ships against Thargoids before or have prior PVP combat experience. These ships offer different flight characteristics, new hardpoint setups and generally some variety while requiring more experience to use effectively.

## Tabset {.tabset}

### Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)

#### **Alliance Challenger (Shieldless)**

The Alliance Challenger, sister ship of the more popular Alliance Chieftain, is a slower alternative with higher damage output against an interceptor’s shields. Depending on preference, it can also have more raw hull than a standard Chieftain build. Its three medium hardpoints with good convergence make it a better platform for running modified Shard Cannons or Plasma Chargers.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Kalkan:
- Zırh: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: A great ship for those who find the Chieftain too responsive.

### Federal Corvette (Shieldless)

#### **Federal Corvette (Shieldless)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. When shieldless, it stays icy cold while firing on all cylinders.

Type: **Cold Orbiter**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Çeviklik: ⭐⭐⭐
- Kalkan:
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

### Federal Corvette (Shielded)

#### **Federal Corvette (Shielded)**

One of the "big three" the Federal Corvette is a force to be reckoned with. Offering a huge power distrubutor and massive hull, the ship loses out only on speed. While this ship takes more skill to fly, it is a favorite of many an experienced AX pilot. By utilizing prismatic or even bi-weave shields, the Corvette can slug it out with the toughest of targets. Type: **Shield Tank**

- Speed: ⭐⭐
- Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
- Shield:⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Ateş gücü: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Recommendation: An outstanding large ship for those looking for such a thing. Requires good knowledge of AX mechanics.

# Scout Gemileri
Hunting scouts is a very efficient method to increase combat rank. This is because all scouts are considered dangerous or deadly targets and will give a lot of experience per kill. Due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Due to the unpredictable flight nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of Large Turreted Anti-Xeno Multi-Cannons as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. Keep in mind that there is a limit of 4 AX Weapons per vessel.

## Diğer Önerilen Modüller
- **Decontamination Limpet Controller (and Cargo Racks)** - For when hit by caustic missiles.
- **Xeno Scanner (optional)** - Lets you see scout health %.
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Scouts deal phasing damage which will damage you through shields, you will require both heavy Shields AND Hull.

Ultimately, due to the simple nature of scout hunting, almost any ship can be retrofitted for the task quite easily. A simple rule of thumb is….

- Decent Hull
- Decent Shields
- Lots of AX Multi-Cannons
- Decontamination Limpets

And you’re good to go!

[**Krait Mk.II Coriolis Build**](https://coriolis.io/outfit/krait_mkii?code=A2pptkFflfdussf5x3x3x3x10sxs040404B12d2dy303292H2G08.Iw18eQ%3D%3D.IwBj4yoo.H4sIAAAAAAAAA43Rv0vDcBAF8Nc0rdbGpkmb0oq%2FjQodio5d3AQHhW466iodFRwUdHMu4uTgn%2BAg6NBROjs6iIiTo0MnrXfeFT2wUzM8Htwn%2BSYX0AiA75REryWRbTvA%2BKkHBDvSwvssEHcTACdozeSJxGjji9l%2FrQGlG1fkozyIHSoZOpDwFRXLPebo2gfK70lg4bwgMkkTJo9Uxp%2FM%2FeOKx5HIZ5mwS6uKXJ3vfsj89o2ZU1S3W88kMh4xj10EwJy2eW2L2pa0cZr2%2FniYXwZqG13myuaUjDzatidNS1Qb%2BP3m%2FvkV5ZyjdUNX%2BiY6ClcOBT1kgJmnnCB%2FGJQfBgW0ZWhfwtHtpXXF2bpsL3iRiFTGbd14SFXjl%2FoD76TmZidFagt17bE2LgzKpsmmSW1cGpQdkx2T2pjx%2F%2FoBomHYA08CAAA%3D.EweloBhBmSQUwIYHMA28QgIwVyKBQA%3D%3D&bn=AX%20Krait)
- Can fit 3x AX Multi-Cannons in large hardpoints and 1x AX Multi-Cannon in a medium slot
- Alternatively can fit 2x AX Multi-Cannons in large hardpoints, and 2x Guardian Gauss Cannons in the medium hardpoints (allows for Gauss aim practice and becomes more effective once the user is proficient with Gauss)
- High mobility to keep targets in range or disengage.
- Mobility allows for use of Bi-Weave shields, disengaging for shield regen.
