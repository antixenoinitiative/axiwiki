<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>First things first: Speedrunning is not for newcomer pilots to Anti-Xeno combat.</p>
<p>We generally recommend CMDRs attain at least the Serpent’s Nemesis rank (Medusa solo) before they focus on learning the advanced techniques involved in speedrunning.</p>
<h1>Speedrunning Ranks</h1>
<p>There are two ranks associated with speed kills: Myrmidon and Caduceus’ Glint</p>
<h2>Myrmidon - “Silver” color</h2>
<p>Myrmidon is the “Vanguard” equivalent rank for speedrunning kills. Whereas Vanguard requires you to do a complex or off-meta kill, but gives you no time limit, Myrmidon allows you to use a meta ship, but gives you a strict time limit.</p>
<p>Time limits, for a solo Medusa kill,are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>24’00’’000’’’ - Small Ship</li>
  <li>12’00’’000’’’ - Medium Ship</li>
  <li>6’00’’000’’’ - Large Ship</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cadeceus’ Glint - “Gold” color</h2>
<p>Caduceus’ glint, or glint for short, is the “Ace” equivalent for speedrunning kills. It is one of only two “competitive” ranks - as in, you can lose this rank.</p>
<p>Only up to 9 glint CMDRs can exist at any one point, and typically (because a CMDR can hold a record in more than one category) there will be fewer than 9.</p>
<p>Glint is awarded for the fastest small/medium/large ship kill on Basilisk, Medusa, and Hydra. Cyclops do NOT award a Glint rank.</p>

<h1>Speedrunning Theory</h1>
<p>Speedrunning is about killing a Thargoid in the shortest amount possible, without resorting to bugs or unintended mechanics (e.g., “gibbing”).</p>
<p>In order to get started, the first thing you’ll want to understand is the detailed behavior of Goid AI upon heart distruction. Understanding this is critical to avoid triggering “panic shields”:</p>

<h1>Speedrunning Techniques</h1>
<h2>Shield Ramming</h2>
<p>Shield ramming can be used in any type of speedrun whether it's <strong>cold orbiting</strong> or <strong>stunlocking</strong>. Ramming interceptor's shield most of the time implies triggering <strong>special attack</strong> as a result of violating minimum range for:</p>
<p>· <strong>Lightning</strong> if interceptor is active;</p>
<p>· <strong>Caustic missiles</strong> if interceptor is in sleep phase;</p>
<p>· <strong>Shutdown field</strong> if it's second to last sleep phase (along with caustic missiles).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's break down most common shieldrams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Shield after first heart.</p>
<p>After destroying first heart interceptor initiates a <strong>lightning chase</strong> which:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Encourages us to ram it's shield;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Blocks interceptor's ability to deploy <strong>panic shield</strong> regardless of how fast this shield will get destroyed.</p>
<p>Lightning does insignificant amount of hull damage because of it's low AP so it's a common trade of ship hull for instant shield removal.</p>
<p>To successfully ram shield off you need to:</p>
<p>· Back off a little bit from interceptor after destroying it's first heart;</p>
<p>· Line up and boost into the interceptor so you ram shield before zap kills your momentum.</p>
<p>Usually lightning duration is enough to exert and destroy next heart after successful shieldram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Shield after all other hearts.</p>
<p>As we already know, after every heart destruction except first one, interceptor falls into <strong>sleep phase</strong> meanwhile deploying new shield. If you want to ram this shield off, you should expect interrupting <strong>sleep phase</strong> because of violating <strong>minimum detection range</strong> (roughly 700m).</p>
<p>And that's where it's getting more complicated, because without full knowledge on how panic shields are triggered, you will end up causing exactly that.</p>
<p>To successfully ram shield off you need:</p>
<p>· Count to 7 (every second) from the moment when shield got deployed (cue: green dots and lights along with "exhale" noise)</p>
<p>· Trigger <strong>caustic missiles</strong> and wait until <i><u>ALL</u></i> of them are released (cue: after releasing all caustic missiles, interceptor petals stop glowing bright red)</p>
<p>· Line up for the ram and boost</p>
<p>Without those steps one may end up triggering <strong>panic shield</strong> either due to <strong>overwhelming shield damage</strong> or <strong>countermeasure deployment</strong>.</p>
<p>In case of shieldramming in second to last sleep phase, you should expect triggering <strong>shutdown field</strong> which implies that you have <strong>shutdown field neutralizer</strong> equipped.</p>
