# Yaygın Donanım Hataları
AX mekanikleri net bir şekilde anlaşılmadığında AX gemisi toplarken basit hatalar yapmak çok kolaydır. İnsanların geçmişte sık yaptıkları hatalardan bazılarını sunuyoruz ki siz yapmayın:

## Gereksiz "Utility"ler
### tabs {.tabset}
#### Point Defence
İlk başta güzel bir fikir gibi gözükse de Point Defence Thargoid savaşlarında tamamen işlevsiz. Hem Caustic hem de Thargon füzelerine karşı savunma ateşi açsa da onları vurabilme becerisinden yoksun. Destek olmadıkları gibi bir de dost Flak mermilerini vurarak köstek olma alışkanlıkları var.

#### Chaff
Chaff'ın hiçbir Thargoid'e karşı bir etkisi yoktur ve AX savaşında size hiçbir fayda sağlamaz. Onun yerine benzer bir etkiyi Cold Orbiting ile yakalamalısınız.

#### Electronic Countermeasures
Similar to chaff, Electronic Countermeasures have no effect on Thargoid missiles or other weapons systems.

## Ship Launched Fighters
A somewhat controversial topic as there are still some particular uses for these, however in typical AX fights, Ship Launched Fighters (or SLFs) are more of a bother than they are a benefit. Due to their paper thin hull, mediocre damage and laughable lifespan, even a SLF in the hands of a good pilot will still be less beneficial to perhaps using that same module slot for some more armour. Keep in mind that an AI pilot will also be taking a cut of all profits and rank obtained in the meantime too.

Also:
- SLF will aggro the swarm making it fly erratically, thus harder to destroy
- SLF NPC will steal half your combat rank
- SLF will not aggro the interceptor
- The swarm will destroy a SLF in 4-5 hits, due to phasing damage.

## Flechette VS Flak
Remote Release Flak Launcher and Remote Release Flechette Launcher are easily mixed up…

> Flak is super effective against Thargon swarms

> Flechette is not…

## Resistances
Thargoid weapons deal absolute/caustic damage, this means any Thermal/Kinetic/Explosion resistances on either your shields or hull will do nothing and be completely bypassed. Focus only on absolute shield and hull values. Resistance is futile.

## Weapons
Although other AX weapons may be interesting and fun, nothing beats a Gauss Cannon. Due to Armour Penetration values, Guardian Gauss cannons have the highest effective AX damage per second. Focus on learning how to use Gauss Cannons properly and you will have a far easier time as the Interceptors you engage get tougher.

Guardian Shard Cannons and Guardian Plasma Chargers simply cannot keep up with the DPS and effectiveness of Gauss.

Shards also require the pilot to be within Lightning attack range to achieve maximum DPS effect.

For scout hunting, avoid fixed AXMCs. Scouts have very erratic movement and they can prove very difficult to hit with fixed projectile-based weapons. They make for good Gauss target practice though, since they are roughly the same size as an Interceptor’s Heart, and Gauss is a hitscan-based weapon.
