# Convergence

Convergence is a term commonly used in regards to how well fixed weapons converge on the enemy target. For example, a very wide ship with weapons on each wing-tip may have very poor convergence because the hardpoints are very far apart from each other.

This becomes very important when using weapons that do not have any gimbal/turreted or automatic adjustment (micro-gimbal, such as small Gauss).

In AX combat, it is important that your weapons (Gauss in particular) have a very small convergence area. This will allow all of your weapons to be able to hit a small target (like a Thargoid Heart) simultaneously.

You can place weapons in hardpoints that are physically close together to improve convergence.

You can use [Elite Dangerous Ship Anatomy](http://a.teall.info/edsa/) to see how each ship's hardpoints converge, and to decide which hardpoints lead to optimal convergance. You can also use this to see the location of internals and utility slots.


## Good Convergence

## Bad Convergence

The outer hardpoints on the cutter have very poor convergence. ![convergebad.png](/img/convergebad.png)
