# Finding Thargoids
Thargoids are an elusive bunch but there are certain tricks and hotspots that can help you find what you are looking for. The most consistent means is to find Thargoids in **Non-Human Signal Sources (NHSS)** in either the Pleiades Region, Coalsack Nebula or the Witch Head Nebula. However, you can also find Thargoids at a few static locations across human space.
