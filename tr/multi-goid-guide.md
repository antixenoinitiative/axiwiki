# Multi-Thargoid Combat Manual

*By CMDR EuanAB*

When dealing with multiple thargoids at once there are certain strategies and techniques you will need to account for to make sure you donâ€™t end on a rebuy. This guide will be broken in to 4 parts:

-   Multiple Slow Thargoids
-   Multiple Basilisks
-   Multiple Slow Thargoids and Basilisks
-   General Tactics

## General Tactics

You can summon a Cyclops into an instance by supplying any interceptor(s) present with 5 items of Thargoid tech such as meta alloys. This can be used to get a triple Cyclops without having to be hyperdicted, using a distress call. However only one can be summoned. The only way to have more than a single Thargoid summoned is to get hyperdicted by 3+ interceptors, then feed them 15+ meta alloys. Often, they will fight over the meta alloys and aggro before summoning any thargoids, and to prevent that you need to mask your heat signature with either heatsinks or silent running. Up to 3 can be summoned depending on how much the interceptors fight for the meta alloys. If you want to summon more, spin while jettisoning the meta alloys to place them in different places, minimising the chance of them fighting.

Without flak, there may be problems, but you should only not have flak on a small ship, as large ships should have more than enough weapon spaces and mediums usually do, too. But if you don't have one you should orbit well around the interceptor(s), and keep away from the swarm, as if it envelopes you it may turn to missiles. This may give you more time to rearm and repair if you can outrun all the thargoids, as you have no swarm to deal with.

Enrage in multigoid fights is not too bad, if you have flak you can reduce them to a very low number and carry on and if you have no flak enrage does not mean much as you can continue orbiting and not letting the swarm envelope you, which stops it from becoming a barrage of missiles.

## Multiple Slow Thargoids

*This applies to taking on multiple slow thargoids (Cyclops, Medusa, Hydra).*

They're the same speed (~450m/s), slower than the swarm, making it easier to flak if you have one. You can treat it like a normal kill.

If there are multiple different variants, killing hearts on the weaker variants then moving to the strong ones is better as you will take less damage killing the harder hearts. Kill hearts like you usually would, but be aware of the damage you are taking. If it's too much you may have to run, and repair. Take one interceptor at a time, having multiple with lightning available is very risky as you could get lightning from an interceptor you are not targeting. This allows the rest to destroy you quite quickly as you are stationary.

## Multiple Basilisks

*This applies to having multiple Thargoid Basilisk variants in one fight.*

Basilisks go around 530m/s, which is faster than the swarm, making it potentially difficult to flak if you have one. Make sure that is done before an attack run. Basilisks generally have quite weak hearts, so try to make quick work of them one at a time. Try not to get hit by lightning during an attack run, that will allow the others to kill you very quickly. Stay aware of your hull during an attack run, as you may have to bail.

## Multiple Slow Thargoids and Basilisks

*This applies to having a mix of Basilisks and other slow thargoids in one fight.*

Having these all together means the Basilisk(s) will fly ahead. It is convenient to kill them, as outrunning them will mean the others fall behind and can despawn, or wake out. The order thus is Basilisk > Cyclops > Medusa > Hydra.

For any multikills in ships that can't outrun any of them (Corvette, Anaconda) try to kill as many interceptors as fast as possible while taking the absolute least amount of damage possible, making sure you do not try to reboot as they will be able to get to you faster and kill you without shields. Once there is only one thargoid left, you may resume normal kill tactics.
