# A Brief Intro to the Maelstrom

The Thargoid Maelstrom is a <rl>new type of instance</rl> <nwt>system point of interest (POI)</nwt> that appeared alongside the Thargoid invasion <nwt>event</nwt> in Nov 3308. These instances have appeared in several systems and <nwt>they</nwt> are an incredibly dangerous anomaly. <rl>which purpose is currently unknown. All 8 UIA causing the Maelstroms impacted.</rl><nwt>Thargoid Maelstrom POIs are multilayered and the first POI that may make you want to think twice about disengaging your supercruise in the dropzone. Maelstrom POIs have massive caustic zones, that we call *the cloud*, and dropping at the HUD's perfect spot indicator will land your vessel inside of the outer caustic zone of *the cloud*. Unless you are prepared to drop into caustic, plan to drop one tick next to the "drop zone" indicated by the HUD. Upon arrival, the storm is quite visible, and the scale of it can be disorienting. A slow approach to the scrambled instance center indicator is recommended. Cautious commanders can identify the boundry between safe space and caustic cloud. Adventurous commanders have discovered that braving the caustic to get to the center yields no reward. This is because a powerful enemy lurks resides and the center, and upon your approach, a massive energy wave will be deployed to repell all invaders. Due to the inquisitive, dedicated, and perhaps misguided commanders exploring the Maelstrom's inner caustic zone, technology has been developed to allow commanders immunity to the repulsion wave that protects the massive entity at the center of the Maelstrom; if you choose to brave this journey, behold, the ***Titan***.</nwt>

### Maelstrom Systems
<nwt>Maelstroms are in close orbit to ammonia worlds. </nwt>The current systems <nwt>with a Maelstrom POI: </nwt><rl>having Maelstrom cloud and all of its effects are:</rl>

| Maelstrom   | System                    | Planetary Body | Distance from Star to POI ± 10% Ls |

<nwt>The listed planets are ammonia worlds and have a distinct spot in the FSS radar. They should be easy to find. Make sure to turn in your cartographic data to make permanent these locations in your system maps.</nwt>


## Maelstrom Dangers

<rl>System Wide Impacts</rl>

When in the same system as a Thargoid Maelstrom, Guardian Modules <rl>are</rl><nwt> become</nwt> functionally unusable<nwt>;</nwt> <rl>and</rl><nwt> Guardian modules</nwt> will decay while anywhere <nwt>within</nwt> <rl>in the</rl><nwt> a</nwt> system at a constant rate.
- Guardian weapons, Guardian Module Reinforcement, and Guardian Shield Reinforcement decay at a rate of 1%/s.
- The Guardian Power Plant and Guardian Power Distributor decay at a rate of 1% every 10 seconds, but do not decay lower than 19%.
- The Guardian Hull Reinforcement is immune, because it does not have integrity of its own.

<rl>The</rl> Thargoid Maelstrom <nwt>POIs are </nwt><rl>is a </rl>large cloud-like area<nwt>s;</nwt> these appear similar to Lagrange clouds. Travel<rl>l</rl>ing inside the cloud will incur significant caustic damage; <rl>and</rl> it is ill advised to travel within the cloud without preparations. The cloud is an area of <rl>swarming</rl><nwt> sprawling</nwt> lightning storms and various Thargoid-related anomalies. Caustic Generators<nwt>, an anomoly only found within the caustic zone of the maelstrom cloud,</nwt> can be seen floating <nwt>and sporadically manuevering</nwt> in the cloud and are most likely the source of the caustic damage area.

<nwt>The cloud anatomy is mostly spherical with the following notable dimensions:</nwt>
- Outer radius: 115km (Sensor interference begins)
- Intermediate radius: 79km (Caustic and tidal effects begin and get progressively worse the further in one goes; caustic generators, <rl>and</rl> free-floating Caustic Shards and Caustic Crystals are present)
- Repulsion field radius: 55km (Trigger repulsion field at this range)
- Inner cloud radius: 30km ('Eye of the Storm', safe from repulsion field, caustic and tidal effects) ![maelstroms_ver_3.1.5.png](/maelstroms_ver_3.1.5.png)

## Maelstrom Rewards
<rl> Caustic Material Farming </rl><!--- \[![smol gen\](/maelstrom_cg_tumb.png)](/img/caustic_generator_2.png) --->

</a>
Throughout the Maelstrom, besides the materials that can be acquired directly on indirectly from **Caustic generators**, there are two-types of free-floating materials that can be gathered.

These generators are also heat based Mines, these mines when detecting heat slowly drift towards ship and then explode, causing a 3km caustic explosion with a knock-back effect. Current safe heat threshold is unknown and subject to further testing.

These Caustic generators are checked on by Thargoid Interceptors flying about within the Maelstrom, these Interceptors are typically passive however become hostile within a certain range, this is still being researched and may not be completely accurate.

Destroying a Caustic Generator will cause it to drop various materials which can be collected. These materials are used for Caustic Sink synthesis, along with unlocking the Caustic Sink Launcher itself.

### Materials {.tabset}

#### **Corrosive Mechanisms**

<a href="/img/corrosive_mechannism_2.png">
    <img src ="/img/maelstrom_tn02.png" align = right 
        title = "Click for the Full Image"
        alt = "smol corrosive mechanism image" />
</a>

  Individual caustic sinks last 43 seconds in minimal caustic (just inside the perimeter) and 27 seconds 20km deep inside perimeter. Ammo-capacity engineered Caustic Sinks Launchers thus provide approximately 4-6 minutes of protection each, not including ammo synthesis (which is possible, but expensive in terms of materials.)



#### **Caustic Shards (Common)**

<a href="/img/caustic_shard_1.png">
    <img src ="/img/maelstrom_tn03.png" align = right
        title = "Click for the Full Image"
        alt = "smol Caustic Shard image" />
</a>

Caustic Shards are used to unlock Caustic Sink Launchers, and in Caustic Sink Ammo Synthesis (4 required per synth)

#### **Caustic Crystals (Rare)**

<a href="/img/caustic_crystal_2.png">
    <img src ="/img/maelstrom_tn04.png" align = right
        title = "Click for the Full Image"
        alt = "smol Caustic Shard image" />
</a>

Caustic Crystals have no known use at this time.



The center of the Maelstrom is a large red-ish cloud, approaching the center will cause a large EMP-like pulse to emit from the Center which will eject any ships at a high velocity, shutting them down and damaging them in the process. Being hit by the pulse grants the CMDR a single instance of **Massive Energy Surge Analytics** encoded material.
