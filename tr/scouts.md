# Scouts
!\[scouts.jpg\](/img/scouts.jpg =450x){.align-right}Scouts are a smaller Thargoid vessel and can be found in all types of Non-Human Signal Source. Scouts are immediately hostile and in groups can deal significant damage to an unprepared pilot. Scouts, unlike interceptors, have 77% resistance to human weapons, rather than 99%. This reduced damage resistance makes it possible to kill Scouts with human weapon systems, however specialized AX weapon systems are still far more effective and efficient than their human counterparts.

# Variants

Thargoid scouts come in multiple variants, each with their own special abilities.

## Marauder
Marauders are the basic variant of scout and the most common, They have a simple attack using a Basic Pulse Weapon and can also fire a simple Caustic missile.

## Regenerator
Regenerator variants are the same as the Marauder but have a special Regeneration pulse ability. The Regenerator may use this ability and apply a regeneration buff to all nearby scouts, rapidly regenerating their health. Regenerators will make an audible sound before using the attack and emit a green pulse. Regenerator variants will appear with a green coloration.

## Beserker
Similar to Regenerator, Beserker variants are marauders with a special ability. Beserkers can emit a red energy pulse that will buff the damage of all nearby scouts and trigger all nearby non-beserker scouts to fire a caustic missile. Beserkers have an Orange/red appearance.

## Inciter
Inciters are the same as a marauders with a special ability. When used the scout will emit an energy pulse to all nearby scouts, buffing their speed and maneuverability temporarily. Inciters have a pink/red appearance.

# Traits
- Scouts are ALWAYS hostile.
- Scouts have 77% resistance to conventional human weapons.
- Scouts are immune to missiles and torpedoes (they bounce off).
- Scouts occasionally shoot caustic missiles.
- The pulse of the special Scouts is instance-wide, which means it can affect very distant targets.

# Hunting Scouts

Hunting scouts is a very efficient method to increase combat rank. Due to the 77% resistance to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against scouts. Due to the unpredictable nature of scouts, we strongly recommend the use of Large Turreted Anti-Xeno Multicannons as the most effective weapon for hunting scouts.

These are best suited as they are not affected by the 77% resistance, can actively stay on target with scouts and are very ammo-efficient. Keep in mind that there is a limit of 4 Weapons per vessel.
