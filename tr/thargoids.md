# Thargoidler
!\[cyclops-small.png\](/img/Cyclops-small.png =250x){.align-right} ***Thargoidler** insanlığa karşı sürekli saldırganlık göstermiş, insan olmayan bir canlı türüdür.*

*Kayda geçen ilk Thargoid karşılaşması 2849 yılında olmasına rağmen daha önce, belgelenmemiş karşılaşmaların olduğu da düşünülmektedir. Daha sonraki yıllarda, yalnız gezegen Thargoid araçlarıyla karşılaşmalar da ara ara rapor edilmiştir.*

*32'nci yüzyılda insanlar Thargoidlerle çarpıştılar ancak bu savaşa dair detaylı bilgilere nadir ulaşılması bir yana; gerçek bilgilerle, sansasyonalist medyada yayılan yalan haberleri birbirinden ayırmak çok zordu.*

*Elite: Dangerous Codex'inden bir Girdi*

## Thargoid Araçları

Thargoids come in 5 known classes: the Titan, interceptor, hunter, scout, and ground variant.

Thargoid **Titans** are large capital class Thargoid vessels, and can be found at the center of Maelstroms. Thargoid planetary structures surface sites, and barnacle matrix sites also bear many similarities to the Titans found in space. Read more about these on the [**Maelstrom**](/en/Maelstrom) page.

Thargoid [**Interceptors**](/en/interceptors) come in five variants: Orthrus, Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa and Hydra, in ascending level of difficulty. Each next variant has more [**hearts**](/en/hearts) and is tougher than the last, requiring more damage destroy them. The Orthrus is a special class of interceptor without hearts. Interceptors use very high damage output weapons, crowd-control style special abilities, and deploy [**Thargon drone swarms**](/en/thargon-swarms) to wreak havoc on the battlefield.

Thargoid **Hunters** are the newest class spotted, and come in two variants: Glaives and Scythes. Hunters have very high mobility, fire FSD disruptor and caustic missiles, and deploy an anti-guardian field similar to the Orthrus.

Thargoid [**Scouts**](/en/scouts) are a smaller variant of the Thargoid interceptor. They come in four variants: Berserker, Inciter, Marauder, and Regenerator. Each with different special abilities. Read more about these in the [**Thargoid Scouts**](/en/scouts) section.

Thargoid ground variants come in two forms: Revenants and Scavengers. Scavengers maintain and protect Thargoid structures. Revenants are found at barnacle matrices and occupy human ground bases in Controlled systems. ![thargoid_combatants.png](/img/thargoid_combatants.png)

## Thargoid Encounters

As pilots travel between planets, stars, and systems, we find our existence threatened by these vocal and destructive xenos. Hyperdictions and interdictions by Thargoids can be devastating depending on the Thargoid and the number of them that make it into the encounter.

 Thargoid interceptors and glaives have the highest rate for hyperdiction, and scouts for interdictions. Thargoid interceptors have incredibly strong armour and fast regeneration capabilities, this makes conventional weapons (Multi-cannons, Missiles, Plasma Accelerators, Lasers, etc.) completely ineffective at damaging them. Even Hunters and Scouts still have a high resistance to conventional weaponry. Thankfully humanity has not only developed their own line of Anti-Xeno (AX) weaponry, but we have also adapted the ancient Guardian technology into very powerful hybrid weapons and modules that are far more effective at destroying Thargoid vessels.

Attempting Thargoid combat with the appropriate defenses, weaponry, and strategy is paramount to ensuring success and help avoid the rebuy screen.
