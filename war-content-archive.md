The absence of Titans (and maelstroms) and Spire sites have made these builds obsolete:
- **Maelstrom Builds** - Heavily specialized for combat in the most extreme locations - where caustic clouds are thick, staying undetected is paramount, and guardian tech is useless. These build have the same base hull configuration as Solo Builds, but share little else.

- **Spire Builds** - Even more like shooting fish in a barrel, Thargoid Spire sites are very low intensity combat zones where Cyclops interceptors and Scouts occasionally spawn, and where Orthrus interceptors are found in large numbers.  Builds for Spire sites are designed for maximum shield damage to Orthrus.

# Retired Builds
**There are no more Titans or Spire sites**, therefore, these builds are outdated and no longer used. They are kept here for posterity and historical reference, and in the event that Fdev decides to return this content to us.

## Titan Builds
Titan Maelstroms contain an anti-guardian field and large caustic zones.  Specialized ships are required to be effective in these operating conditions, and Guardian internal modules will be destroyed; Guardian weapons (but not modules)  can, however, be engineered to avoid this. These are modifications of other meta ships, designed to either strike directly at the Titan itself, or to provide combat interdiciton to Thargoid Scouts or Interceptors in Titan space, with various specific modifications.

### Extra Modules Suggested
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Protects you from the caustic clouds and missiles present in Maelstrom combat.
- **Thargoid Pulse Neutralizers** - Required for passing into the center of a Maelstrom, these also act against Interceptor shutdown pulses.
- **Thermal Vent engineered Beam Lasers** - These enable cold running in combat, reducing the likelihood and accuracy of incoming fire.
- **Nanite Torpedo Launcher** - This torpedo launcher can damage the thermal vents on the dorsal side of the Titan, causing the Titan to expose its thermal core, which enables damage to the Titan itself.

  ### Krait Mk.II Bomber (Shieldless) - "Farseer"beginner build
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  DISCLAIMER – this build is recommended only as an entry-level stepping stone towards more effective builds. 

  PREREQUISITES – Access to Felicity Farseer is required, and will enable you to engineer your Power Plant, Thrusters, Frame shift Drive and Sensors.  You will need to donate 1x meta alloy, a commodity which can be purchased from Fleet Carriers, for access to Felicity Farseer's engienering workshop.  Once access is acquired you will need to obtain the following engineering materials:

    7x Iron
    3x Hybrid Capacitors
    2x Heat Vanes
    3x Specialized Legacy Firmware
    1x Mechanical Equipment
    3x Vanadium
    5x Grid Resistors
    1x Chromium
    1x Mechanical Components

  If you wish to engineer your sensors for long range you will also need these further materials:

    3x Iron
    2x Hybrid capacitors
    1x Unexpected Emission Data

  USING THIS BUILD – You will need to run cold to avoid detection, by turning off the Frame Shift Drive, Repair Limpet Controller, Auto Field Maintenance Unit, one Heatsink Launcher, and the Cargo Hatch when not in use. Retreat to the asteroid belt near the Titan where enemy ships will not follow, before turning any of these back on for repairs.  You will also need to synthesize heatsinks to stay in titan space for any length of time, so it would be prudent to stock up on a lagre quantity of the following:

    Basic Conductors
    Heat Conduction Wiring

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 AX and 2s class 2 Missile Racks
  - 1x Guaridan Nanite Torpoedo Pylon
  - Speed: 346m/s, 476m/s boost
  - Hull: 1,376

  ### Krait Mk.II Bomber (Shieldless)
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  The Krait Mk.II is the workhorse of the Second Thargoid War, offering substantial firepower and optional internals, while still maintaining good maneuverability.

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 AX Missile Racks (Sirius AX Missile Racks are most effective, and are in the build but require a lot of materials to purchase; Enhanced AX Missile Racks are also effective)
  - 1x class 2 gimballed beam laser with Long Range and Thermal Vent
  - Speed: 322m/s, 544m/s boost
  - Hull: 3,358

  ### Krait Mk.II Fighter (Shieldless)
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}

  A Fighter variant of the Titankiller Bomber Krait.

  - Armaments: 3x class 3 and 1x class 2 AX Multi-Cannons - Azimuth Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons are incredibly effective but generate significant heat, and are expensive to purchase; Enhanced AX Multi-Cannons, purchased from Rescue Megaships are a very acceptable alternative, and Guardian Shard Cannons with anti-Guardian field engineering are also a highly powerful alternative
  - 1x class 2 gimballed beam laser with Long Range and Thermal Vent
  - Speed: 323/s, 547m/s boost

  [TitanKiller Fighter Build](https://edsy.org/#/L=HE5b9FA-0H4C0SC0,L5110L5110L5110L3n10EjHH07P_W0,CjwG-2G002P000S_00CjxG02G_W0EAk00EB400,9p3H05I_W0ABkH05K_W0APoG05I_W0AdsS-5J_W60upD6upD8qpDE_PcGzcQKsPcAsOG030_W0BAEG03L_W0BOmG05G_W0Bcg10,,0AA206kK2016yH05I_W025S1015OK05I_W013qJ05I_W00KU3020m101-C10,Titankiller_0v2_E0F_0L,XSF)


## Spire Builds
Thargoid Spire sites are low-threat conflict zones where Orthrus-type interceptors come and go regularly.  Combat in Spire sites assists with the recapturing of systems from Titans.  When engaged, Orthrus will summon packs of Scouts, and occasionally a Cyclops, to defend them.  Combat bonds for Orthrus kills are especially high at 15 million credits.

As with all Thargoid ships, due to the **77% resistance** to human weapons it is very inefficient to use normal weapons against them. Orthrus have a particularly strong shield, and will fire both a shutdown field, and an anti-Guardian field, when engaged.  The shutdown field can be countered with a Shutdown Field Neutraliser.  The anti-Guardian field immediately starts eroding the guardian modules and weapons of its target, and cannot be countered.  This means when weapons are subjected to the anti-Guardian field, the CMDR is in a race against time to destroy the Orthrus before their weapons completely fail.  

### Extra Modules Suggested
- **Caustic Sink Launcher** - Thargoids emit caustic clouds when they die, and taking caustic damage is inevitable.
- **Shutdown Field Neutraliser** - For countering the shutdown field emitted by Orthrus and Cyclops on engagement.  
- **Hull Reinforcements** - Thargoids attacks phase through shields, meaning you need a strong hull to withstand their attacks.

The general premise of Spire site builds is to create a ship which can survive in the caustic environment without resupplying.  this means:

- Decent Hull
- Strong damage to all Thargoid ship types 
- Ability to remove caustic damage
- Self-repair functionality

  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless Missiles)
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  The Krait can fit 3x Large and 2x Medium Enchanced AX Multi-Cannons (for Scouts) or Missile Racks (for Orthrus).  It can also be useful to swap 1x class 2 hardpoint for a Thermal Vent Beam Laser, for tagging Orthrus targets at range.  The Krait has high mobility to keep targets in range or disengage.  Overall, this build has strong all-round performance with great endurance, power and speed, and reasonable damage output.  The Missile variant is also particularly useful for clearing the Banshee skimmer-type missile launchers from Spire sites.  

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: A great entry-level ship for Spire AX.

  ### Krait Mk.II (Shieldless Guardian)
  ![krait-mk-ii.png](/img/krait-mk-ii.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Krait Mk.II**

  This build is very similar to the entry-level Missiles/Multi-cannons build but with enhanced engineering on the power plant to drive powerful Guardian weapons.  Modified Guardian plasma chargers and shard cannons are highly effective against Orthrus shields, albeit vulnerable to Anti-Guardian Fields.  Auto-Field Maintenance Units are therefore mandatory for these build types. 

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Agile and packs a punch, and strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Cyclops.

  [**Shieldless Krait Guardian Weapons Build**](https://edsy.org/#/L=HE5b9FA-0H4C0S20,EkhG07P_W0LYOG-2G0090y0051Cp98HkDFm0H058K_7YP4JAV700YpXvLYOG-2G0090y0051Cp98HkDFm0H058K_7YP4JAV700YpXvLYOG-2G0090y0051Cp98HkDFm0H058K_7YP4JAV700YpXvLYOG-2G0090y0051Cp98HkDFm0H058K_7YP4JAV700YpXv,CjxmEeT2G_W0CjxmEeT2Gsd1OwPcCjxG02G_W0EB4WP1vP,9onnf8e5m5I_W0ABknj89263I_W0APomZ3Oeo5I_W0Adtmf1R7g5J_W0AsOm2OK30_W0BAEmb22Jd3L_W0BOmmR2_d5G_W0BcgXJ1Jn,,0AAXN5PF6kKWI1SZ16ynR61d5I_W025SXR61d15OnT2vg5I_W013qnU17_5I_W00KUWVZ8x20mX6Us1-CX1EI,XSF_0Ethics_0Gradient,AXC_D2T)


  ### Anaconda (Shielded)
  ![anaconda.png](/img/anaconda.png =250x){.align-right}
  #### **Anaconda (Shielded)**

  CMDR Mechan's famous "CytoPlasmaConda" build is designed to very effectively strip Orthrus shields.  Building this ship equires access to the Cytoscrambler lasers, a PowerPlay module from Archon Delaine.  Slow but extremely powerful, it is also vulnerable to  Anti-Guardian Fields so again, Auto-Field Maintenance Units are mandatory.

  - Speed: ⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: Not very agile but huge damage output; requires some finesse, especially for escaping interdictions.

  [**CytoPlasmaConda Build**](https://edsy.org/#/L=H64kUSZW0H4C0S40,LYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLLYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLLYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLLYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLLYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLLYVH-2Gxq60vBh4zHx8y00Cw00H800KvLLExiH09M_W0ExiH09M_W0,CjxG02G_W0CjxG02G_W0CjxG02G_W0CjxG02G_W0CjwG02G_W0CjwG02G_W0EBD00EAk00,9onH05I_W0ADIH074_W0ARMG05I_W0AfQG05J_W0AtyG03G_W0BBoG03L_W0BRuG05G_W0Bcg10,16yH05I_W0,4p_207UeG07L_W00AA101Oc403Ju0025S1016yH05I_W00M2300M2300M23020m101-C10,CytoPlasmaConda,AX_DCPC)

  ### Python Mk. II (Shielded)

  #### **Python Mk.II (Shielded)**

  This ship requires access to Class 2 and 3 Guardian Shard Cannons, as well as Guardian Zone Engineering from Ram Tah.  The Python Mk. II build is designed to strike at Orthrus interceptors in a solo instance, dodging incoming Banshee missiles and stacking a second Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser for when they can't be dodged, or attempting a strike run. Due to the internal module constraints of the Python Mk. II, this build also stacks Caustic sink Launchers to deal with Caustic damage and Shield Boosters, to shrug off incoming Scout fire. 

  - Speed: ⭐⭐⭐
  - Agility: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Armour: ⭐⭐
  - Firepower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  Recommendation: In the hands of a competent pilot this ship is highly capable of effectively demolishing Orthrus interceptors in a solo instance. The Shard Cannons can be used to clear Scouts but this is highly inefficient use of ammunition, so strike-and-run tactics work well here.
