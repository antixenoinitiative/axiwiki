# AX Combat + Wings!

Winged Combat
---

1. Use Solo Builds
 - While you may wish to be a mobile repair ship or a shield stripping menace, the various bugs which surface in wing combat can force you into a difficult position if you cannot do damage. Bring a solo capable ship and let coordination and skill rule the fight.
2. Coordinate your attacks
 - Before a shield drops, have your wing ready to simultaneously attack. The more people atttacking, the greater the dps, the faster the exert, and the less gauss/heatsinks used per attack run.
3. Mind the Aggro
 - The damage you deal can be used to pull aggro off a wingmate. It can also inadvertently interfere with a wingmate kiting the Thargoid. Be aware of what impact your damage will have. Communicate with your wingmates.
4. Warn about the Swarm
 - If you pass through an active swarm, call out to your wingmates that you have done so. When you fly through a swarm you toggle its state between agitated and deagitated. An agitated swarm launches missiles. Warn your wingmates so everybody is aware of the possible danger.
5. Post Heart Procedures
 - **Get and Stay Cold,** or over 3 km from the Thargoid, to avoid triggering caustic missiles and shutdown fields (see [bypass mechanics](/en/mechanic-bypass)). Keep hearts in mind. After the first hear, the Tharoid will attempt a lightning chase. After the 2nd to final hear, the Thargoid will look for ship signatures to deploy a shutdown field upon.
6. Don't Die
 - If you are the last of your wing in the instance, disengage from the fight and stay alive in the instance until your wingmates return and can provide anchor for you. Thargoid combat is hard until it's not.
 
 # Wing Battle Guide
 Original wiki article written by CMDR Ghosti has been lazily localized for us English peepz:
 
 Wing battles are all battles involving multiple players. As this introduces different mechanics and gameplay bugs, wing battles can be harder or easier depending on how you handle it. Wing battles differ from individual battles in a few key ways:

- Aggro management
- Swarm management (based on reason 1 above)
- Dealing with shield meltdown
- Distance management
- The challenge of cold reboots after heartbreak
- Coordination & communication
- Bug management

## Aggro Management

In individual battles the aggro is always on you, but in wing battles the Interceptor only focuses on one person. This is important for two main reasons:

1. **Aiming for Hearts**: It's always easier for the interceptor focused pilot to aim at exerted hearts. For this reason, if you are not in an advantageous position, then you should not take the aggro from the commander with opportunity.

2. **Temperature Management and Reboot/Repair**: Thargoid capabilities can be bypassed while maintaining low temperature levels and based on current target temperature. It may also be possible to divert Thargoid's attention away from a pilot who needs a reboot, repair, and/or synthesis.

The interceptor always focuses on the ship with the highest threat; that is, the one that deals the most damage. However, the interceptor's aggro is "sticky" and will not pick another target for the first ~30 seconds. This means that after the aggro change, for a short time; A grace period occurs where wingmates can attack or shield the interceptor without risking lightning strikes nor triggering caustic missiles.

If you need to return to the station, make sure someone else picks up the aggro. If the pilot with the interceptor's target-lock jumps and leaves the environment, then the interceptor can also disengage and wake out of the instance. It can do this immediately, or it can do it after the departing pilot returns. Naturally, no one gets anything if the interceptor leaves the environment.

If the invulnerable heart bug has appeared (you find that you are unable to inflict damage to the heart), cease fire. If you have aggro, try to position yourself so that your wingmates can easily damage the Interceptor.

## Swarm Management

Swarms focus on and follow one veseesl in battle. However, Swarms fires at all ships within range. Generally, in winng battles, teammates take care of the interceptor, while only the person with swarm aggro has the responsibility to destroy the wwarm. If the swarm's current target doesn't have flak, then it might be good for someone with flak to try to take over the Swarm aggro. If the swarm abandons its target, the person who lost the aggro shall notify their teammates immediately.

Sometimes you can get the swarm aggro on you by lasering it, or going near it, but this is not a surefire method.

If your wingmate is unable to destroy the swarm, or is in danger, try to engage the swarm.

## Dealing with Shield Decay

In wing battles, the interceptor's shield can be quickly destroyed by beam lasers, cytoscramblers, bumping (deploying Rammo Ammo), and other less-desireable weapon fire. Bumping can also be a good method, but it can cause a Heart loop reset bug.

## Distance Management

Kiting any interceptor in solo, doesn't have too many problems. In contrast, with wing combat, the interceptor should not be dragged too far from the instance center. Without paying heed to this courtesy, large and/or slow ships may have difficulty engaging in the fight, effectively excluding them from the fight and fun.

Whether the shield is down, in sleep phase, or in the attack phase, you can cause problems that will disrupt your wingmate's flight and combat strategies.

All pilots must be able to attack in a coordinated manner while the heart is exerted, and it must be ensured that no one is left at a distance. If you are not sure about your heart exertion attack run, you should avoid engagements that will take the aggro onto yourself, while others can take the exert snipe opportunity.

## Interceptor Scans

Since the interceptor scan information is shared with all wing members, only one person needs to have the Xeno Scanner, even if they have no intention of seeing Thargoid data or the swarm count. Scan data can also be shared by leaving the wing with scan data and joining a wing that does not have scan data.

## After Heart Breaking

After the Interceptor loses a Heart, it shields and enters the caustic missile launch phase. Caustic missiles are only fired if the Interceptor's current target is detected. So if the person with aggro stays cold, you won't have to encounter any caustic missiles or EMPs.

If you have aggro after Heartbreak:
Trigger the heatsink, boost and go away. Make sure you're at least 3km away, but don't go too far.
Trigger the heatsink to lower your temperature to 0 and keep your temperature low with your Thermal Vent lasers. Stay close to the Interceptor so it stays stationary until it starts attacking again.
On a ship without a shield, turn on silent running and get away with boost or stay cool with your lasers.
If you don't have aggro after Heartbreak:

Do not shoot if your temperature is above 15%. Even TV Beam can then pull aggro and trigger caustic missiles for the entire wing. Instead, fire your Beam after reducing your heatsink to 0.
Do not shoot Gaussian.
Do not bump (unless you are coordinated for safe process*).
Don't boost too far (unless you're dodging caustic missiles).
*See Aggro Management section

Even if you manage to drop the shields, do not fire before the caustic missile period ends. Otherwise caustic missiles will be triggered and a new shield will appear.

In the process, shielded ships can regenerate their shields with a reboot or shield healing lasers.

If a pilot is doing a cold restart and someone else above the 15-18% detection threshold takes on the aggro, this restart can be disrupted by caustic missiles launched. If you have trouble communicating, reboot when out of range of the Interceptor or consider using different hardware.

"Regeneration Sequence" and "Concordant Sequence" experimental engineering effects that allow you to regenerate shields can be useful in wing battles. It is possible to quickly renew the shields of your wing friends. They are especially useful on Prismatic shields, which rarely stay above 50%.

## Coordination & Communication

Communication is critical in Wing battles. If possible, all pilots in combat should be in voice chat or use the in-game chat window. If it is not possible to speak, it is better than nothing to even turn off your microphone and join the voice chat.

Take care to use voice chat only when sharing necessary information. Here are some examples of what needs to be talked about/announced:

- Energy surge / EMP
- Call for help, ask for someone else to get aggro
- Shield break / shield percentage status
- Coordinating the attack phases
- Swarm status and behavior
- Specify the action to take

When the last heart is shattered, even the Hydra can be easily destroyed by a single ship.

Before you destroy it with the final attack, make sure all your teammates have fired at least one shot recently so everyone can seize the bounty. Another example of the importance of communication.

## Bug Management

All pilots participating in the war should master the bugs related to AX and try to prevent them as much as possible. Suggested actions:

- Jump into signal sources at the same time, (use nav-lock functions for this) 
- Avoid ramming unless you really know what you're doing
- Enable the "port forwarding" method as opposed to using UPnP: [Ultimate Port Forwarding Guide from MGram](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/da2qh3/elitedangerous_port_forwarding_mega_guide/)
- Communicate, Communicate, and Communicate
